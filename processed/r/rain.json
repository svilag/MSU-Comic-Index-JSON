It rains and he stays dry. Fountains and car radiators go wild. People around him blame it on atomic bomb testing. He finds he can't even get a drink. He goes back to the shore to look for the bottle, and is able to walk right out into the ocean with the water parting before him. There he finds a stranded alien spaceship which can't function in water. The bottle of water repellent was supposed to dry the ship so it could take off, but the tides grabbed it before it could do its work. The ship then takes off and sprays the beachcomber with an antidote, which leaves him wet and happy."

      "Summary: Professor Wallace de Wolff has found an early nineteenth-century painting of a gothic cathedral in a tropical rainforest, and curiosity leads him to learn of a group of renegade church architects called the Chavesians. The Chavesians had run afoul of the Inquisition, and were exiled to the New World by Queen Isabella, just a few years after Columbus's first voyage. After wandering in the wilderness for awhile, they found a spot in the Amazon jungle and began building cathedrals. Professor De Wolff, still only suspecting much of this, mounts an expedition to the Amazon which includes his son, Sidney, and his assistant, Fay McKee. Meanwhile, on another world, we find that at the end of the previous album Rork had teleported into a situation that has caused a cosmic imbalance, and the aliens decide they have to send him back. Rork lands, almost dead, in the company of the expedition just as they are being attacked by Indians. His presence saves the explorers, and they nurse him back to health. Rork is sensitive to forces coming from the cathedrals, and soon leads them there. An ancient madman tries to chase them away, and Rork identifies him as the evil force he felt. They find another man chained, and he seems to be the good force. Sidney de Wolff dies in a struggle with the madman at the center of a maze. They find another 500-year-old man, named Vosta, and release him from chains. Vosta tells the story of the colony. Rork tells Vosta that they'll meet again in a year, at Rork's house. The company breaks up, and on the way north Rork learns that Sidney's skeleton is inside the body of Vosta. In a wordless epilog Rork gets a message written in the language of the undersea civilization, and starts walking into a desert."

Finding common creative ground in spite of their bi-coastal publishing ventures, the two started working together immediately, and have since combined for a series of acclaimed and successful Mexi-mask projects. Now with the world catching up, the Muchas and VaVooms and Nachos, the two creators look back on a decade of collaboration in this 112-page collection of original illustrations, paintings, and never-before-seen sketches of the masked men (and women) they so love.\""
