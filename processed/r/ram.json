Still less do they expect to find themselves spending the rest of the day hearing stories about the land they are standing on. Stories about the gods and humans who inhabited it. Of the river Pampo who yearned to marry Shiva. Of Vali, the insecure king of Kishkindha, and of Rama who was unable to give his faithful lieutenant, Hanuman, the one thing he desired. More mysterious is the storyteller, an ascetic, who insists that the brothers are destined to become rulers of a mighty empire.\""

      "Summary (from SkyRiver): Former Captain Marvel Monica Rambeau teams up with Carol Danvers to uncover a mechanical mystery : a deep-sea danger decades in the making, and when an indestructible menace rises from the depth, the two women take sisterhood to new heights as they combine forces to bring it down! But as Carol returns home after the encounter, she finds herself a changed woman. Something is weakening her powers and threatens to ground the high-flying hero for good. A new version of an old foe enters the fray, and Captain America gives Carol new wings in the form of old wheels as the incredible adventures of Earth's mightiest hero continue!"

The park's general manager is convinced that Rick was destined to greet Fengxian customers, dressed as none other than Ricky Rouse.

Moe has a habit of having prophetic dreams, or affective dreams. His brother, a hood who sees a way to profit from this one, gathers together the heads of the Metropolis mobs and introduces Moe as the man who can beat Superman. At the same time Superman finds that his super-strength ebbs and flows, sometimes present but at other times embarassingly absent. Finally he has a compulsion to go to the arena where Moe is waiting for the fight, which ends as he dreamed it. Superman recovers for the rematch, finds that both his strength and invulnerability have returned and Moe is beaten. He tells Superman about the dreams."

Hot or cold, plain or miso, from fancy fusion creations to humble roadside takeout, ramen is truly a beloved food, one that can give rise to fierce loyalty or fiercer criticism (not to mention the occasional fistfight). In this volume of Oishinbo, Yamaoka and company inquire into the 'soul of ramen,' from the flour used in the noodles to the chickens used in the broth. And where there's ramen, there's gyoza: little dumplings made with a variety of fillings and served as a side dish. Will Yamaoka be able to create an 'ultimate' gyoza before Kaibara creates a 'supreme' one?\""

Waiting for him was not just his own destiny but that of thousands of small, marginalised farmers who, until then, had only known exploitation and deprivation. The story of Dr. Kurien is the story of Amul. It is the story of Operation Flood, the billion-litre idea that set India on the top of the world map for milk production. A die-hard patriot, Kurien was committed to the cooperative cause. He put the milk industry in the hands of the farmers, believing firmly that with ownership would come responsibility and great success. And he was right. Amar Chitra Katha traces the story of the man who is known as the Father of the White Revolution."
