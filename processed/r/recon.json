It is through SeguÃ­n, a pivotal and tragic figure, that Jackson humanizes Texas' fight for independence and provides a human scale for this vast and complex story.\"",

As Jackson wrote, 'Texas reaped a bitter harvest from the War Between the States. Part of this dark legacy was the great unrest that plagued the beaten but unbowed populace.' The tensions caused by Reconstruction are told through the Taylor-Sutton feud, which raged across South Texas, embracing two generations and causing untold grief, and the gunslinger John Wesley Hardin, who swept across Texas killing carpetbaggers, federal soldiers, and Indians.\""

      "Summary: Dante is in the sewers with some new recruits and one of them has dunked the radio. An alert comes through, about a terrorist and a hostage in their area, but the message is garbled. Proceeding to the scene with the recruit and a sergeant, they find a man and woman struggling over a gun. The woman cries for help, so they kill the man. Then the radio starts to work and they realize she's the terrorist, and she has a gun still. With the recruit and the sergeant both shot, she runs out of bullets. The woman taunts Lieutenant Dante, saying he would never shoot a woman in cold blood because it's against the rules. The sergeant uses the last of his strength to lift his gun and shoot her himself, and then dies not knowing that there are two bullets in her body."
