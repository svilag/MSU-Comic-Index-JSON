      "\"With the outbreak of war in 1914, best friends Wally and Roy, and new mate Tom, are among the first to enlist. But their great adventure soon turns to disaster. The day after the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, more than 2000 of their fellow Anzacs are dead and the bold attempt by the Allied commanders to knock the Turks out of the war becomes a stalemate. As the Gallipoli campaign drags on, Wally, Roy and Tom find themselves locked in combat with a formidable enemy, a ferocious landscape, flies, fleas, cold and disease.\"",

      "Summary: Roy Rogers and Pat Brady have assembled a \"gyro-glider\" in sheriff Bob Marsh's back yard. The sheriff gets a call from the Indian hospital saying Dr. John Cloud Mountain has been injured in a Jeep accident and wants to see Roy. Dr. Cloud Mountain is a \"brilliant Navajo surgeon\" and a crusader for \"white man medicine,\" who has detractors among the Indian medicine men. His nurse and fiancée, Marie Bluebell, seems to have been kidnapped while he was unconscious at the site of the wreck. The doctor suspects it was all the work of her father Yellow Singer and her half-brother Short Bull, both bitter opponents of the hospital. Roy and John figure out that Marie Bluebell is being held in a small remote canyon, and to avoid shooting Roy sneaks in for a landing at night in his new and silent man-powered helicopter-glider. Roy and Marie sneak out as far as where Trigger is waiting, but then the shooting starts and Roy tells Marie to ride away. She doesn't go far, and comes back in the nick of time to save Roy. John and Marie get married, and Yellow Singer gives the bride away as a condition for not going to jail."
