      "Summary: Johnny leaves his patrol when Tex spots an unknown Mustang about to be ambushed by a Messerschmitt. It turns out the Mustang pilot didn't need help, but when Johnny returns to his flight it's surrounded by German fighters. Johnny's unexpected return saves the day, and back at the base the new pilot reports. His name is Lt. Tom Talon, and like Cloud he is Native American. The other pilots observe the meeting of the two men with these comments: \"Look at the dead-pan way those two are looking at each other!\" \"Just like Indians! Never showing what they feel!\" We learn that as boys the two men played together on the reservation, and that Talon's brother died during one of their games and Cloud is unfairly blamed for the death. Talon has sworn to kill Cloud, though the other men don't know this. On the next mission Johnny Cloud makes Talon his wingman, demoting a disapproving Tex to no. 3. Talon saves Cloud's life after first putting it in jeopardy. The next day Cloud saves Talon's life nearly at the expense of his own, and lands barely alive in enemy territory. Talon lands to pick him up, and they make it to safety even though being fired upon by a German tank. Talon considers the fact that Cloud saved his life to be payment of the debt for his brother's life.",

      "\"Victor and Eli started out as college roommates, brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong. Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other superpowered person he can find, aside from his own sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible powers on both sides, spurred onward by the memory of betrayal and desperate longings, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge, but who will be left alive at the end?\"",

After all the money is safely moved away from the Beagle Boys, Uncle Scrooge surrounds the reservoir with fences, booby traps and land mines. Soon the Beagle Boys find him and devise a plan to break the dam and flood the money out of the reservoir. After they succeed, Uncle Scrooge convinces them to dive into the money head first, which knocks them all unconscious and gives Scrooge time to get all his money back."

Meanwhile at home Isabel, the mother of Carlos, deals with a difficult customer, who insults her and takes the sewing she has done without paying. Carlos is outraged, but his mother is resigned to her fate. Then Carlos produces the money he has received from his father, and she accepts this fate also.

The novel is preceded by Rollins's own clear, straightforward text explaining how to conceive, write, and finally draw, ink, and letter a graphic novel. Tasks are broken down into manageable pieces that can be understood even by beginners. The unique process allows readers to look over the shoulder of an artist as he creates, and then read the final masterwork."

Time and again she dodged his harpoons and smashed his ships, but the years have come and gone, the seasons have changed, as have the whalers' weapons. Now instead of a harpoon and rope, the men use explosive harpoon guns, and Cross is sure he'll defeat his aquatic nemesis soon. But when he finally finds her in the icy waters of the Antarctic, the vengeful sailor can't bring himself to pull the trigger. Back in the old days their battles were legendary contests of champions. That was whaling, but this? This would be killing, and Jason Cross would never disrespect so worthy a foe."

But Tom doesn't notice that world anymore, because his world is made up of spreadsheets, of phone bills, of software and coffee and button-down shirts. Long ago, Tom had been someone special. Today, Tom has become someone else. A respectable, quiet man with a decent job and a dead dream. But each night, he lies awake, wishing for the chance to do things differently, to be the man he really is. One day, Tom gets his wish. And the world will never forget him again!"
