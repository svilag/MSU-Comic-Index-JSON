Max is a grave-robbing 13-year-old who gathers relics to pawn for comic book money. Macon works at the local Mallmart by day and publishes his comic book manifestos by night. Madison is a punk beauty who just might be able to fly. When Macon gets badly beaten in a fight with his boss over comic books, Macon and Madison take revenge by smashing the front of the store. They leave their calling card graffitied across the wreckage: Comic Book Liberation Army. The next day Max joins in the mayhem and soon the town has declared all-out war on comic books. Thus begins Teenagers From Mars, a chaotic comics extravaganza in which three teens strive against censorship, and adults, to protect the comics they love. Originally published as a series of comics, Teenagers from Mars shows what happens when people who love comics enough to fight for them are forced to."

      "SUMMARY: The ruling Blue Barons of the planet Kazhann are plunderers whose religion is art. The Superior Shaan orders the remains of the rebel Sloan uncovered and brought to him. A woman penetrates the train transporting the corpse, and revives Sloane. Sloane vows to vanquish the Emperor. The woman says her name is Legend, mistress of the \"Guild of Voice,\" a singer. Legend saves Sloane from madness. She explains that the funeral train they are riding is the Emperor's mental projection of Mozart's Requiem, and that she got in by knowing codes and songs taught to her by her father. The Blue Barons learn that Sloane is alive, and determine to help him by rebelling against the Emperor Shaan. One of the Barons' warriors, named Vuzz, salutes Sloane and pledges his aid. Shaan attacks, and reveals that he is what Sloane himself will become after 300 years. Sloane denies this, and says there are alternate futures. Legend attacks, and the evil is defeated. The Blue Barons present Sloane with his reconstructed ship, O Siddharta. Sloane is reunited with Vuzz and Yearl."

For centuries, Deshwitat's mind calculated revenge while his body slumbered...until now. A band of spiritual investigators has inadvertently broken the seal that binds him, and Deshwitat has been released. Redemption. A lot has changed since the 17th century.

He finds that the navigational caste has no idea of what is going on in the rest of the ship and little contact except in emergencies. Superman then goes to the main areas of the ship to stop the war. The combatants stop long enough to explain that they have \"divided into nations according to our various races and religions. Differences inevitably lead to conflict!\" and then resume their fighting. He wishes they could be persuaded to work together as they did in building the ship in the first place",
      "that thought gives him an idea. He sends the ship to a suitable, uninhabited planet and they disembark taking their personal belongings and the useful machinery but leaving the weapons behind. A pleased Superman looks on at the aliens who have put violence and hate aside to make a new civilization."
