      "Summary (by Amy Lazet): G.I. Joe is surprised one day by the appearance of a puppy in the shell-hole he was using for cover. He adopts the dog, names him K.P., and soon adds an orphaned Korean toddler to his retinue. Meanwhile his outfit has been picked to lead an attack on the communists, who are camped across the river. The U.N. armies don't know exactly where the communists are, however, and are afraid of an ambush. G.I. Joe's unit goes to sleep, but when Joe awakens the next morning he finds that the puppy has fallen into the river. G.I. Joe plunges after him, and in doing so draws enemy gunfire, revealing the enemy's hiding place. The U.N. forces are able to obliterate their enemy, allowing for a safe river crossing. When the outfit crosses the river they meet another U.N. outfit, and Joe is informed that he must allow the toddler to be placed in an orphanage. As the car leaves with the weeping child, Joe places the puppy in the boy's arms, saying that the dog is the first installment of repayment for all that the boy has lost in the war."

It rains and he stays dry. Fountains and car radiators go wild. People around him blame it on atomic bomb testing. He finds he can't even get a drink. He goes back to the shore to look for the bottle, and is able to walk right out into the ocean with the water parting before him. There he finds a stranded alien spaceship which can't function in water. The bottle of water repellent was supposed to dry the ship so it could take off, but the tides grabbed it before it could do its work. The ship then takes off and sprays the beachcomber with an antidote, which leaves him wet and happy."

Steve is offered an engineering scholarship at a university, leaving Dot in anguish. Chuck Ross, a supervisor at the factory where Dot works, takes advantage of Steve's absence to get in with Dot and persuades her that, since Steve is away at college and not home with her, Steve doesn't love her. Steve and Dot fight over Christmas break resulting in a break-up, and Chuck moves in on Dot. She doesn't love Chuck, however, and when she learns that Steve is unhappy she visits him at school and repents her demanding ways. Finally Dot is content to wait for Steve while he achieves his dreams, secure in the knowledge that one day they will wed."

Superman-X cures hopeless diseases, etc., but doesn't balance his deeds with self-restraint. Lois and Jimmy show Superman-X a news story in which a child with polio and leg braces is killed in the chaos of people trying to get to the \"savior\" at the hospital gates. Superman-X believes it and leaves in a wail of anguish, but the tape was a fake, nobody has died, although the chaos was real. The real Superman returns soon after (summary by Mary Walker)."

      "Summary (from www.gallimard.fr via OCLC): De juillet 2007 à septembre 2013, Jean-Philippe Stassen a réalisé 5 reportages pour XXI et La revue dessinée au Rwanda, au Congo, en Espagne, au Maroc, en Belgique où il est né, en France ainsi qu'en Afrique du Sud. Ce travail \"africain\" de plusieurs années sur les migrations des victimes de la guerre et de la misère est édité ici sous le titre I comb Jesus (\"Je peigne Jésus\"). Dans tous ses reportages, Stassen écoute et dialogue avec d'anciens enfants-soldats, des rescapés du génocide rwandais, des Congolais installés à Bruxelles, des migrants à Gibraltar ou Johannesburg, mais aussi avec le peintre sud-africain Anton Kannemeyer. Récits incisifs, clairs, intelligents, passionnants, d'une grande beauté graphique, ces reportages dessinés donnent toute la mesure de l'immense talent de Stassen."

The Chef has stolen an ambulance and Moreau has sprained an ankle, so Barelli, Inspector Lapiste, and the ambulance driver give chase. The third ambulance they catch is the right one, but it's empty. They find Randor in a doctor's office near the abandoned vehicle, but not the Chef. Randor is soon kidnapped again from the doctor's office. This doctor is a plastic surgeon, and he is working for the Chef. A secret passage from the doctor's bathroom leads to a chase through tunnels. The Chef gets away, but Randor is recovered and Barelli ends up in a basement cabaret."

      "Summary (from publisher): \"This tenth anniversary edition of the acclaimed and fearless graphic novel features enhanced toned art, an afterword by Mat Johnson, character sketches, and other additional material. In the early 20th Century, when lynchings were commonplace throughout the American South, a few courageous reporters from the North risked their lives to expose these atrocities. They were African-American men who, due to their light skin color, could \"pass\" among the white folks. They called this dangerous assignment going \"incognegro.\" Zane Pinchback, a reporter for the New York-based New Holland Herald, is sent to investigate the arrest of his own brother, charged with the brutal murder of a white woman in Mississippi. With a lynch mob already swarming, Zane must stay \"incognegro\" long enough to uncover the truth behind the murder in order to save his brother, and himself. Suspenseful, unsettling and relevant, [this book] is a tense graphic novel of shifting identities, forbidden passions, and secrets that run far deeper than skin color.\""

Ginny Mueller and the Blackhawks meet in the deserted village, and find Wu Cheng's diary. It describes the building of the dragon, with American aid, and Wu Cheng's efforts to stop it. Imprisoned by the Japanese, Wu Cheng learns that the Japanese attacked his village specifically to lure the Blackhawks there, as part of a bargain with Germany. Ginny's presence as a witness was also arranged by the Japanese. Wu Cheng gets free in time to reveal the set-up and save the day. He re-joins the Blackhawks team."

The foreigners are indeed spies, and Dr. Courtney is found on the premises. He had been working on a \"device to counter guided missiles,\" which is what the spies wanted.
