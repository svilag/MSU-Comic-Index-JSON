The man's name is Percival Belden. Lucky Luke offers to be his manager and set up a boxing match with Killer Kelly, as Kelly is offering a $10,000 prize to anyone who can beat him. Percival agrees because he'd like to have enough money to marry Rosita, and so \"Battling Belden the Butcher\" is born. After a full set of gags about boxing and betting, the fight is about to begin when Rosita is kidnapped. A note says that if Belden wins the fight he'll never see Rosita again. Belden gets in the ring and starts letting himself be knocked down, while Lucky Luke rides out in search of Rosita, returning just in time to allow Belden to win the match with one punch."

      "Summary: The Redcoat soldiers arrest a man in the street who complains loudly of his fate, but when he is taken to the commanding officer it turns out he's an undercover agent, a traitor turning over a list of patriots' names. Lord Marmaduke Langsburry, an emisary direct from the King in London, witnesses the transaction and asks to see the list. Lord Langsburry pockets the list, then removes his beard to reveal that he is indeed Captain Swing. In short order the traitor is dead, and the fine carriage that brought \"Langsburry\" has left at a gallop. The British soldiers take off after the carriage, making it easy for Swing to sneak out of the headquarters to hide with his old friend Professor Griffith. The professor is puzzling over an old Rosicrucian book he bought from an antiquarian book dealer in Strasbourg. The reading isn't going well since it's Greco-Latino-Hebraic in runic characters. By chance, a soldier has seen Swing enter Griffith's house, so the soldiers come and the two have to flee. Also there is a sinister-looking bald man lurking in the house looking for a chance to steal the book. The professor takes the book with him, and they ride to Fort Ontario. Betty sets the professor up with a place to study. The creepy bald man returns to his home as well, on Black Skull Mountain, which is not far from Fort Ontario. He thinks awhile, then sends one of his superstitious Black servants, named Mumbulah, to go to Fort Ontario on Lake Ontario and retrieve the book, no matter whose life it costs. Meanwhile Griffith suddenly figures out the book, and it makes him crazy. He babbles nonsense and ancient-sounding words, and tries to kill Mister Bluff's dog, Pouik, by hanging it by the neck with a rope. Griffith's raving is so violent they have to tie him up. Mumbulah arrives at the fort and tries to steal the book, but gets locked up for his trouble. Hibou thinks sorcery is involved. Taking the book, Swing rides out from Lake Ontario for a few hours to a mountain cave full of books, bottles and a smoking brazier. Swing asks the wise man there to take a look at the book, and the wise man is interested. He says to come back in a few days when he's studied the book. Meanwhile, the strange bald man from Black Skull Mountain shows up at Fort Ontario asking for lodging. As he enters both Griffith and Mumbulah can be heard raving from their respective lockups, and Mister Bluff wonders if it might be the weather causing it. Hibou says that Indians lose their spirit in captivity too, and in sympathy lets Mumbulah out for some exercise. Mumbulah sees his master and immediately commits suicide by jumping from a tower. Then the bald man hypnotizes Betty from behind without her having even seen him. He tells her to go to town and buy a blue dress, and when she leaves the fort on foot he kidnaps her. When Swing comes back from delivering the book to his guru, a ransom note is found. The Rosicrucian book must be brought to Black Skull Mountain in exchange for Betty's life. Swing, Bluff and Hibou retrace Swing's path to retrieve the book, and arrive just as the wise man has deciphered it. He also starts raving and has to be tied up. The bald man gets excited when he mentally feels the book approaching, the book that was \"stolen from them at Tubingen.\" The man tries to capture Swing rather than release Betty, and in the struggle the book and the whole house are burned to ashes. At that moment both of the raving scholars are released from their spells miles apart. They get together at Fort Ontario and agree that the destruction of the book was a good thing. The one from the mountain, the one that Swing calls \"master,\" quotes Shakespeare: \"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosopy.\""

      "\"Since the late 1990s, Japanese comics, or manga, have become established as a globally-successful print medium. Striving for the transcultural and transdisciplinary exchange between Japanese manga researchers, European comics experts, and japanologists, this anthology addresses itself to readers who take an interest in cultural, historical, and theoretical reflections on reading manga. Its first part focuses on the case study of Nakazwa Keiji's Barefoot Gen (Hadashi no Gen, 1973-1987), paying special attention to its reception indifferent cultures. Because of its subject matter Barefoot Gen provokes explorations of comics' potential to narrate history realistically which is the object of attention in the second part. Finally, the third part highlights a variety of topics related to the impact of manga on other comics cultures. In accordance with the fact that comics studies can be conceptualized only as a multidisciplinary field of research, the contributors to this anthology deploy a variety of angles: from media history and cultural studies to linguistics and social sciences as well as gender studies and aesthetics.\""
