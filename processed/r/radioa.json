Dante's head gets hurt and he goes to a doctor, where the x-ray machine gets struck by lightning, and suddenly he really can read minds. He reads the mind of a man who is thinking about some radium in an open safe at a hospital. He steals the radium, and leaves it with a hospital groundskeeper as he makes his getaway. The next day Dante comes back to find the radium, and can't read the groundskeeper's mind to find out where it is. The groundskeeper is an \"imbecile patient here, he has no mind!\"",

La grande qualité de ses nombreux autres strips n'a pas été suffisamment appréciée.\"",

Richard Marschall retraces this little know period of his life, and touches on his personality. He emphasizes Herriman's exceptional intelligence of the essential principles and rhythm of daily strips, then delivers a scholarly report on the Krazy Kat's first appearance in the margin of another series, and its emancipation.\""

Not only must they learn to work together, but tradition has it that they must also live as a couple to blend in with human society. Now the old detectives have been killed, and new representatives must be sent to replace them: one female angel from Heaven and one male demon from Hell. Unfortunately a mistake in Heaven's paperwork has resulted in not a female but a male angel to be sent to Earth.
