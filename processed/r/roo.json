      "SUMMARY: Since Ricardo wants to be part of the gang the other boys arrange an initiation. First Ricardo has to carry each of them on his back like a horse. Then he has to let them throw him in the school's rooftop cistern. This is accomplished, but Ricardo can't get himself out of the cistern, sinks to the bottom, and drowns. Carlos pulls him out, and he seems dead, but he's not, quite. The teacher hears the commotion, takes Ricardo to the school doctor, and covers for the boys with the administration. At home Ricardo's mother insists that they move him to a new school. In a private talk with his father Ricardo explains everything, says he deserved his punishment, and wants to stay in the public school. The father understands because he wasn't always rich, and makes up a story to calm his wife. Things go better at school among the boys, and after a few days Ricardo dismisses his chauffeur so he can play baseball in an alley. Since it's a dirty place Ricardo takes his shoes off, and Memín guards them. Some bigger boys come along and want to use the area for their own game, and a fistfight starts. During the confusion a thief picks up Ricardo's shoes."

      "Summary: A scientist rejects science as useless for discovering the secret of time travel and turns to black magic instead. When he hears of a woman related to a witch burned in 1692 living nearby, he spies on her through a window and sees her summon the ghost of her ancestor. She confirms to the ghost that only she can travel through time by means of 'the room without a door.' The scientist gets the witch evicted and buys the house so that he can search for this room. He finds a small box with wallpaper made to resemble a room. He breaks the box open and finds himself back in 1692 tied to a burning stake.",
