Little did he know how much he would get involved in the country's freedom struggle. Those were the days when the non-cooperation movement had gathered immense momentum and it was in Varanasi that Chandra Shekhar first confronted British authority. After that there was no looking back. Assuming the surname 'Azad' he and his band of revolutionaries did much to awaken in the Indian people the desire for freedom. Martyred at the age of 25, Chandra Shekhar Azad has left an indelible mark on the history of Indian independence.\""

Rocky Langford, age 16, is sent to bed without supper in a nearby orphanage, and decides to run away. Rocky soon rescues Lassie from some trigger-happy country folk, and they run away together. Rocky needs a job, but on his first try a sawmill boss knocks him out and steals Lassie. They recover and escape again, and hitch a ride with a friendly family that's relocating. The family helps Rocky get a job on a riverboat heading for New Orleans. In New Orleans, Rocky rescues a boy and gets a job at a boatyard with the boy's grateful guardian. Rocky learns the trade, gets his own sloop by fixing it up, and sails away with Lassie to see the world. A storm comes up, Lassie is washed overboard, and Rocky makes it to Jamaica with his boat half wrecked. Meanwhile Lassie has been rescued by Mr. Lawrence, a plantation owner, and his yacht, and his daughter Gerry. The yacht has come to Jamaica too, and Lassie finds Rocky. Mr. Lawrence offers Rocky a job as timekeeper on his coffee plantation, partly because he wants Gerry to have someone her own age nearby."
