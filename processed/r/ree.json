      "Summary (from publisher description via SkyRiver): What if Heaven and Hell were rival corporations and instead of sales, their charts tracked souls? And what if one company decided to initiate a hostile takeover of the other? The Apocalypse plan tells this story. Mr. Abaddon is called to the office to investigate a macabre scene; a board room full of Morningstar employees, all dead in a grisly way. The cause of their deaths is a mystery; toxic gas? Infection? murder? The no-nonsense Abaddon attempts to solve the problem in the most immediate way possible, with the help of an impressionable young woman named Theda. Together they discover a plot to destroy Morningstar and its influence on mankind, a plot masterminded by their rival company, the Grace Corporation. Can they stop this assault in time? Or will the world suffer a hostile takeover of biblical proportions?"

Mary revealed three secrets to the children in order to redeem humanity from its sinful ways. On October 13th, tens of thousands witnessed Mary's miracle of the dancing sun at high noon. A year later, the two youngest children died, leaving Lúcia Santos as the sole survivor of the miraculous visions. She became a nun and disclosed the first two secrets to her superiors at the Vatican. The third secret was written down in the form of a letter and sealed for decades.

Reed's poetically streetwise sensibility and style works in surprising harmony with Poe's dark chronicles of terror and despair, just as Mattotti's vivid, abstracted and enigmatic paintings perfectly complement Reed's haunting, contemporary interpretation of Poe's vision."

      "Summary: Télé awakes to a power failure with only his/her shadow for company. Télé follows a parade of prehistoric looking, Genet-quoting animal monsters, which joins a group of women truckdrivers and their trucks. A mysterious bodiless shadow is also following the parade. Télé is captured by the kamioneuses (or camioneuses). The truckdrivers are then set upon by a rival gang, the précieuses (or gracieuses), who drive smaller cars. While trying to escape in the confusion with a Proust-quoting monster, Télé is captured by the new gang, but freed by a kiss from the mysterious shadow. Télé flees with the monsters, pursued by both gangs while the city begins to flood. The monsters (quoting Robert Desnos) and Télé make it to a market in the suburbs for a good meal underwater, chewing their literature. The kamioneuses refuel and have a beer. Most of the rest of the story is underwater, with fish going by. Télé is captured by a band of rockeuses (or rockettes), and the animals flee. Both the kamioneuses and the gracieuses see the animals without Télé, and the camioneuses soon attack the rockettes, trying to retrieve Télé. The rockettes escape on their Vespas with a wounded Télé. Télé is left in the care of Garance, the dauphine of the rockettes, who wants to stay home and read comics anyhow. Her pile of comics includes Popeye, Spirou, Tintin and The Spirit. Garance takes Télé on a flying scooter ride, and they visit the Fairy of Domesticity. The fairy hooks Télé up to a futuramama machine and makes predictions. Télé's shadow asks the fairy's shadow about the mysterious shadow. The fairy makes a pay phone ring where the shadow is and she (with the animals quoting Robert Desnos again) is reunited with Télé's shadow. Télé leaves, with the animals quoting Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, to find the shadow's body. The three gangs declare peace. While Télé is still searching, the animals quote Lou Reed &amp; Philip K. Dick. Climbing above the water, Télé finds his/her true love stuck in another dimension, but crashes through to a happy ending.",

This fourth and final volume finds Madame Xanadu in 1963 New York City, where she encounters a young woman from Harlem who sees horrific metamorphoses right in front of her eyes. It all leads to a mind-reading ad executive, a woman who gets visions of her food's demise and a young boy whose powerful sense of smell may hold the key to unlocking a mystery."
