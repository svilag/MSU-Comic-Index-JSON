Proceeding to the scene with the recruit and a sergeant, they find a man and woman struggling over a gun. The woman cries for help, so they kill the man. Then the radio starts to work and they realize she's the terrorist, and she has a gun still. With the recruit and the sergeant both shot, she runs out of bullets. The woman taunts Lieutenant Dante, saying he would never shoot a woman in cold blood because it's against the rules. The sergeant uses the last of his strength to lift his gun and shoot her himself, and then dies not knowing that there are two bullets in her body."

      "\"During the seventeenth century, the Mughals reigned supreme over Northern and Central India. In the Deccan endless battles went on between other kings like Adil Shah of Bijapur and chiefs like the Nawab of Janjira. The common man suffered at the hands of the officers as well as the marauding Khans and Sardars. Even the zeal of such fighting races as the Rajputs had been suppressed by centuries of slavery under Mughal rule. Many of them had become mere puppets, holdings posts of honour under their royal masters. At such a period was Shivaji born. He was the son of an incredibly brave father and a wise and loving mother. These two and a teacher named Dadoji were the moulding influences on Shivaji's character. The boy showed an uncommon understanding of the happenings around him. The wicked deeds of the ruling class made him angry and restless. The flame of freedom burnt in the little boy's heart. He collected around him a band of devoted followers and as they grew up they swore to throw off the yoke of alien rule. How Shivaji carried out his ambitious plans with success, is told in pictures in the following pages.\"",
