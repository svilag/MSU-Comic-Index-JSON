      "Summary: Fort Brix is under siege, and food and ammunition are almost gone. Captain Swing sneaks in through a passageway only he knows, to try to encourage the defenders. Only two more days and reenforcements will arrive. Colonel Hopkins is in despair, though. If the British actually push their advantage the fort won't last two hours. Hopkins wonders how Swing got past the British lines and Swing explains, but somebody overhears. That night a silver platter is thrown out the window of Fort Brix with the details of the secret passage scratched on it. The British sneak in. Only Captain Swing, the Colonel's daughter Vivian, and her fiancé Bertie Wilkins survive. Swing is badly wounded. He tells a general investigating the case that he only told Colonel Hopkins about the passage, and although the Colonel is dead he is disgraced as a traitor. Capt. Swing takes several weeks to recover from his wounds. Then, at an inn, Swing accidentally finds the silver platter because of a confusion of luggage with another guest. The confusion is soon corrected and Swing doesn't know the significance of the platter, but Vivian and Bertie chance to come in as he is holding it. Bertie recognizes it, and since he signed the message with his initials decides that Swing must already know about his treachery. Bertie's efforts to recover the platter are to no avail, of course, because the other customer has it and has gone on his way. Swing is knocked out by a mysterious man searching his room (it was Bertie) and is invited to Vivian's place to recover. Vivian seems to have a slave named Sam, or at least a very obsequious Black servant and cook. Bertie hires a man to kill Swing, and has Mister Bluff (Swing's sidekick) taken hostage. The ransom note demands the silver plate, but Swing doesn't know what that's about. Swing is being held at gunpoint by the kidnappers when Pouik (Bluff's dog) brings him a pistol and joins the fray. Hibou (another sidekick) turns up as well, and Bluff is soon freed. The man with the platter knows its significance, and returns to ask Vivian for 200 guineas to prove her father's innocence. Bertie Wilkins gets to the man first, stabs him, and takes the platter. The man lives long enough to explain it to Vivian and Swing. Swing finds Wilkins trying to bury the platter, and the game is up. The Hopkins name is cleared, and Vivian is single again."

Percival agrees because he'd like to have enough money to marry Rosita, and so \"Battling Belden the Butcher\" is born. After a full set of gags about boxing and betting, the fight is about to begin when Rosita is kidnapped. A note says that if Belden wins the fight he'll never see Rosita again. Belden gets in the ring and starts letting himself be knocked down, while Lucky Luke rides out in search of Rosita, returning just in time to allow Belden to win the match with one punch."

      "Summary: Arriving in Calcutta by train, Indy reports to a colonial policeman named Blake that a traveling companion was attacked by thugs, and he saved her. She is a dancer, named Kamala. Indy meets up with reporter Marya Smirnova, who tells him she has information about a lost temple. That night they go to Kamala's performance, and while they're walking her to the hotel she is kidnapped by Thugs. Indy tells the story of the Thugs, a cult of Kali now apparently revived after a century of dormancy. When Indy and Marya arrive at Bhubaneshwar to look for the temple and Kamala, Marya is met at the train by the Rolls-Royce of the Maharajah, who turns out to be an old chum of Marya's named Sardar. They are invited to be guests at his palace. That evening just outside the palace they hear a speech by Mahatma Gandhi, who is organizing to resist the British government. On a tiger hunt the next day Jones falls off his elephant and kills a tiger right away, and finds that the tiger was guarding a cave leading to the temple. That night Indy and Marya sneak in and see Kamala in chains, and hear the announcement of her sacrifice to Kali the next day. On the way out they lose their way and find a cave of lepers, who try to escape, but Indy locks them back in. Next day Marya figures out that Sardar is the chief of the Thugs, and that night they sneak into the temple ceremony in disguise. Kamala is made to dance before her death, and Indy grabs her just in time, while Marya grabs a big ruby from Kali's statue. They discover that the colonial policeman from Calcutta is one of the Thugs. To help them in their escape, Indy releases the lepers. Once outside the cave, Kamala grabs the ruby and throws it back in, whereupon the cave collapses. She explains that she is a priestess of Kali, chosen since birth by the Thugs for this sacrifice. She had tried to flee, but the policeman, Blake, brought her back. Blake, the son of an Englishman and Indian woman, felt rejected by both communities and revived the Thugs as revenge to start an uprising against the British and to sabotage Gandhi's movement."

      "Summary: The Redcoat soldiers arrest a man in the street who complains loudly of his fate, but when he is taken to the commanding officer it turns out he's an undercover agent, a traitor turning over a list of patriots' names. Lord Marmaduke Langsburry, an emisary direct from the King in London, witnesses the transaction and asks to see the list. Lord Langsburry pockets the list, then removes his beard to reveal that he is indeed Captain Swing. In short order the traitor is dead, and the fine carriage that brought \"Langsburry\" has left at a gallop. The British soldiers take off after the carriage, making it easy for Swing to sneak out of the headquarters to hide with his old friend Professor Griffith. The professor is puzzling over an old Rosicrucian book he bought from an antiquarian book dealer in Strasbourg. The reading isn't going well since it's Greco-Latino-Hebraic in runic characters. By chance, a soldier has seen Swing enter Griffith's house, so the soldiers come and the two have to flee. Also there is a sinister-looking bald man lurking in the house looking for a chance to steal the book. The professor takes the book with him, and they ride to Fort Ontario. Betty sets the professor up with a place to study. The creepy bald man returns to his home as well, on Black Skull Mountain, which is not far from Fort Ontario. He thinks awhile, then sends one of his superstitious Black servants, named Mumbulah, to go to Fort Ontario on Lake Ontario and retrieve the book, no matter whose life it costs. Meanwhile Griffith suddenly figures out the book, and it makes him crazy. He babbles nonsense and ancient-sounding words, and tries to kill Mister Bluff's dog, Pouik, by hanging it by the neck with a rope. Griffith's raving is so violent they have to tie him up. Mumbulah arrives at the fort and tries to steal the book, but gets locked up for his trouble. Hibou thinks sorcery is involved. Taking the book, Swing rides out from Lake Ontario for a few hours to a mountain cave full of books, bottles and a smoking brazier. Swing asks the wise man there to take a look at the book, and the wise man is interested. He says to come back in a few days when he's studied the book. Meanwhile, the strange bald man from Black Skull Mountain shows up at Fort Ontario asking for lodging. As he enters both Griffith and Mumbulah can be heard raving from their respective lockups, and Mister Bluff wonders if it might be the weather causing it. Hibou says that Indians lose their spirit in captivity too, and in sympathy lets Mumbulah out for some exercise. Mumbulah sees his master and immediately commits suicide by jumping from a tower. Then the bald man hypnotizes Betty from behind without her having even seen him. He tells her to go to town and buy a blue dress, and when she leaves the fort on foot he kidnaps her. When Swing comes back from delivering the book to his guru, a ransom note is found. The Rosicrucian book must be brought to Black Skull Mountain in exchange for Betty's life. Swing, Bluff and Hibou retrace Swing's path to retrieve the book, and arrive just as the wise man has deciphered it. He also starts raving and has to be tied up. The bald man gets excited when he mentally feels the book approaching, the book that was \"stolen from them at Tubingen.\" The man tries to capture Swing rather than release Betty, and in the struggle the book and the whole house are burned to ashes. At that moment both of the raving scholars are released from their spells miles apart. They get together at Fort Ontario and agree that the destruction of the book was a good thing. The one from the mountain, the one that Swing calls \"master,\" quotes Shakespeare: \"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosopy.\""

This turbulent age, often called the Asagiri Era or the Time of Mists, saw the great clans wage decades-long wars in attempts to seize power. Far from the fields of battle, Okko the ronin heads a small group of demon hunters, wandering the realms of Empire. He is accompanied by Noburo, a mysterious giant who hides his face behind a red mask, and the whimsical monk Noshin, the sake lover with the power to summon and commune with the spirits of nature. When Tikku's sister Little Carp is kidnapped by pirates, the young fisherman enlists the group's help in finding her. But the quest will have a price, and will lead our four heroes much farther afield than they'd ever imagined. The first of five Cycles by French comics master Hub."

The innkeeper, Simeon, has had a run-in with the bad-tempered Abbott before, so he runs off when Bluff offers to play host. Abbott has a mysterious small chest with him that he seems to be guarding with exaggerated care. Hibou and Bluff are curious, so Hibou ties some pans to Pouik's tail to distract Abbott, and Bluff switches the contents of the chest for some stinky cheese. Meanwhile, a few miles away, Swing is talking to Madame Meyer, a lady from whom the British have just stolen a small chest of family jewels. Also her husband has been missing for three days. When Swing arrives at the inn the English soldiers have gone. He and Bluff look at the jewels and Swing sends Bluff and Hibou to return them to Madame Meyer and to look for her husband, while Swing continues on his previous mission for Dr. Strong. Another guest at the inn overhears and steals the jewels. Meanwhile the Governor has presented the box of stinky cheese to his wife as a gift, and Lt. Abbott is in deep trouble. Three days later Swing hears a troubador singing a ballad of Spartacus, and Swing asks the singer where he can find Spartacus. The singer says he might not even exist, but another audience member says to ask the Redcoats, who have been humiliated by Spartacus a thousand times. Swing meets Spartacus in a bar, goes to his hideout, and asks him for Dr. Strong to join an American attack on the British. Hibou and Bluff, thanks to Pouik's tracking ability, arrive at the hideout at the same time on the trail of the jewel thief. It turns out to be the wife of Spartacus who stole the jewels in order to buy arms for the resistance. It turns out also that Spartacus is just a bandit and he is also holding Mr. Meyer captive. Swing frees Meyer, returns the jewels, and kidnaps Spartacus for trial in an American tribunal."

The sheriff gets a call from the Indian hospital saying Dr. John Cloud Mountain has been injured in a Jeep accident and wants to see Roy. Dr. Cloud Mountain is a \"brilliant Navajo surgeon\" and a crusader for \"white man medicine,\" who has detractors among the Indian medicine men. His nurse and fiancée, Marie Bluebell, seems to have been kidnapped while he was unconscious at the site of the wreck. The doctor suspects it was all the work of her father Yellow Singer and her half-brother Short Bull, both bitter opponents of the hospital. Roy and John figure out that Marie Bluebell is being held in a small remote canyon, and to avoid shooting Roy sneaks in for a landing at night in his new and silent man-powered helicopter-glider. Roy and Marie sneak out as far as where Trigger is waiting, but then the shooting starts and Roy tells Marie to ride away. She doesn't go far, and comes back in the nick of time to save Roy. John and Marie get married, and Yellow Singer gives the bride away as a condition for not going to jail."
