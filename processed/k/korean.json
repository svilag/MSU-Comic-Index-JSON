      "\"'Korean comics: a society through small frames' examines the changing social realities of Korean society from the 1950s through the 1990s by reading its comic books. Featuring the works of twenty one of the best-known South and North Korean artists, the exhibition provides a running commentary that reflects the lives of ordinary people, at once joyful, satirical and penetrating. What shines most prominently through these works is an engaged and vigorous civil society in Korea, continuously challenging and energizing the status quo in whimsical and provocative ways. By so doing, they play an important role in characterizing and distiguishing the culture, sensibility and sentiment of two Koreas.\""

For centuries, Deshwitat's mind calculated revenge while his body slumbered...until now. A band of spiritual investigators has inadvertently broken the seal that binds him, and Deshwitat has been released. Redemption. A lot has changed since the 17th century. Cars have replaced carriages, the Internet connects the world, and vampires have become the stuff of legend. But beneath the veneer of technology, magic and religion still reign supreme. Kalutika is the most powerful person in the world, although few actually know he exists. Prophecy foretold that Kalutika would destroy the Earth. Deshwitat's quest is now not just one of revenge, but of redemption...for himself, and the world. Rebirth. Joined by an excommunicated exorcist and a spiritual investigator, Deshwitat begins his bloodquest. The hunted is now the hunter!\"",

Featuring the works of twenty one of the best-known South and North Korean artists, the exhibition provides a running commentary that reflects the lives of ordinary people, at once joyful, satirical and penetrating. What shines most prominently through these works is an engaged and vigorous civil society in Korea, continuously challenging and energizing the status quo in whimsical and provocative ways. By so doing, they play an important role in characterizing and distiguishing the culture, sensibility and sentiment of two Koreas.\""

He adopts the dog, names him K.P., and soon adds an orphaned Korean toddler to his retinue. Meanwhile his outfit has been picked to lead an attack on the communists, who are camped across the river. The U.N. armies don't know exactly where the communists are, however, and are afraid of an ambush. G.I. Joe's unit goes to sleep, but when Joe awakens the next morning he finds that the puppy has fallen into the river. G.I. Joe plunges after him, and in doing so draws enemy gunfire, revealing the enemy's hiding place. The U.N. forces are able to obliterate their enemy, allowing for a safe river crossing. When the outfit crosses the river they meet another U.N. outfit, and Joe is informed that he must allow the toddler to be placed in an orphanage. As the car leaves with the weeping child, Joe places the puppy in the boy's arms, saying that the dog is the first installment of repayment for all that the boy has lost in the war."

      "Summary: A soldier's funeral is always hard to watch, but the funeral of Joe Yank seemed, in some way, even more painful. How could this happen to such a fun-loving man, always ready to defend his country? The story begins deep in enemy territory. Joe volunteered. His mission was to crawl through a deep, dark tunnel to push out the cowardly enemy Reds. His sergeant watches as Joe is ambushed, captured and tortured. Afterwards, when the Commies leave, Sarge finds the body with Joe's tags. The Sarge doesn't know that Joe has been taken captive for interrogation, and the body must have been someone else's. With a little help from some Russian ladies, Joe single-handedly takes on the Commies and wins his way back. At the camp they all have a good laugh over the tricks Joe pulled on both the Sarge and the Reds.",

When he learns his commanding officers have been shot, as next in command he issues the order to retreat and brings up the rear to ensure the safety of his men. One man is shot by enemy fire, and Le Sage runs back to carry him to safety. Although wounded three times, Le Sage returns to the battlefield and is wounded more seriously a fourth time. He returns to the United States for medical treatment and the award of a Bronze Star."

Then Corporal Smith, who \"savvys Chinese,\" overhears the guards planning to burn down the barracks because they can't afford to feed the prisoners any more. The fire is lit, but when the barracks have burned to the ground there is no sign of the Americans. It turns out that Mummy isn't a traitor after all.

At first things are quiet and he complains constantly that he'd rather be in the infantry, because he wants to see some action. Then the front comes alive and Mike is given a load of ammunition to deliver. A Red plane takes out a bridge right in front of his truck, and he finds a ford but it's defended by Red gunmen. He charges through them and finally meets up with an American patrol. Mike ends up with a truckload of prisoners."
