      "\"In this pulse-pounding second volume of the Nadesico series, the Kaguya's crew makes a startling discovery: a space anomaly is actually a missing interstellar cruiser lost years before, the space battleship Yamoto. And pilot Akito Tenkawa pursues a mystery of his own as he searches the surface of Mars for clues to his identity and the origin of his Martian tattoos, which he has no memory of getting. Then it's space ships, mecha, and interplanetary adventure as the forces of the Earth suddenly rise up en masse from their base on the Moon and surround the Nadesico. Nadesico has great space battles, pulse-pounding action, romance, and a glorious sense of fun that lovingly satirizes space opera and science fiction animation.\"",

      "\"Abstract: Although comics integrate visual and pictorial elements, there can be found a primacy of text over picture, and vice versa, in specific panels or scenes. This means a factual text-picture divide in comics panels. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen questions hierarchies such as these through reciprocal references between text and pictures. Inevitably, this raises doubts about the information value of the individual panels: Is there more going on here than is evident at first glance? Thus League encourages an attentive, investigative attitude towards itself. Through the references inside the book, the comic also raises awareness for the references pointing out of itself, to a canon of literary sources informing Leagues fictional setup.\""

Two years later World War II is in progress and Hans Hein is in the German army. Kid Ryan is taken prisoner in Europe, and the Germans arrange a rematch as a publicity stunt, in a P.O.W. camp. Ryan hasn't been training or eating right, and the fight goes badly for him. In most rounds he is saved only by the bell. At the end of the fight, though, he floors Hein with one punch as his fellow P.O.W.s burst in with guns. Ryan had been playing for time and keeping the Germans cheering loudly while a tunnel into the German arsenal was completed, and the escape plan is a success."

Fred takes the problem to the JSA, saying, \"I want those kids to have a chance to prove that in spite of their handicaps, they are well-regulated, thinking, normal human beings!\" Fred compares a child with cerebral palsy to a general trying to control and army without adequate communications, but with the bravery to keep fighting. The JSA hatches a plan to involve Jimmy's friends in crime fighting, the heroes draw names, and off they go. At the end of the adventures the Society gets back together with Jimmy and Fred. All six of Jimmy's friends have proven their brains and courage, and the JSA is inspired to make a pledge, to treat the physically handicapped as \"fully our equals.\"",
