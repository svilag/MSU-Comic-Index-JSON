      "Summary: Lucky Luke rides toward Nugget City with Dick Digger, the prospector. Dick is in a celebratory mood because he has struck gold, and he's on his way to register his claim and tell his wife and son. Though Dick is cautious enough to have hidden the map to his gold mine in a rum bottle, he can't help drawing attention to himself by spending gold nuggets and shouting about it in a saloon. That night he is robbed of his nuggets and his rum, and gets amnesia from a bump on the head. One of the robbers is apparently a Mexican, named Mestizo, and the other is called Big Belly. Lucky Luke goes looking for the robbers, and after several days he finds them just as they discover the map in the bottle. Lucky Luke gets it away from them, and then lets them steal back an altered version. At this point Lucky Luke disappears, falling over a waterfall. Jolly Jumper, his faithful and unusually clever horse, thinks his master is dead and is about to commit suicide when an Indian fisherman pulls Luke out of his net. Lucky Luke returns the genuine map to the Digger family, while the false map leads the robbers to a perch on a cliff ledge where they're easily captured. When Dick Digger sees Big Belly his memory returns, and the family rides into the sunset in its covered wagon to exploit the mine."
