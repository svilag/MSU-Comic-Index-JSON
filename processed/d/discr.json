A Japanese Zero crash-lands near the base, and a woman survives, managing to make the men think they've captured secret plans. After the squadron has left to take advantage of the plans, the woman steals a gun and kills the radio operator. The crew of Madam X figures out what has happened, and leaves sick bay in a suicide mission to spring the ambush the Japanese have set up. On page 7, a Japanese radioman says, \"Silver disks",

A menudo la dinámica del poder se inverte cuando los niños toman la posición dominante. Analizo la composición visual de las tiras cómicas y el lenguaje de los personajes para demostrar cómo los caricaturistas/artistas manifestan el discurso del poder. La tesis incorpora aspectos teóricos de Arnheim, Kristeva, Foucault y Bajtín. Se puede considerar las tiras cómicas como novelas visuales en serie. Teniendo en cuenta la definición de la novela proporcionada por Bajtín; hago una comparación entre estas dos tiras con las novelas infantiles Peter Pan y Wendy de J.M. Barrie, y Alicia en el País de Maravillas a Través del Espejo de Lewis Carroll.\"",

      "Summary: Fort Brix is under siege, and food and ammunition are almost gone. Captain Swing sneaks in through a passageway only he knows, to try to encourage the defenders. Only two more days and reenforcements will arrive. Colonel Hopkins is in despair, though. If the British actually push their advantage the fort won't last two hours. Hopkins wonders how Swing got past the British lines and Swing explains, but somebody overhears. That night a silver platter is thrown out the window of Fort Brix with the details of the secret passage scratched on it. The British sneak in. Only Captain Swing, the Colonel's daughter Vivian, and her fiancé Bertie Wilkins survive. Swing is badly wounded. He tells a general investigating the case that he only told Colonel Hopkins about the passage, and although the Colonel is dead he is disgraced as a traitor. Capt. Swing takes several weeks to recover from his wounds. Then, at an inn, Swing accidentally finds the silver platter because of a confusion of luggage with another guest. The confusion is soon corrected and Swing doesn't know the significance of the platter, but Vivian and Bertie chance to come in as he is holding it. Bertie recognizes it, and since he signed the message with his initials decides that Swing must already know about his treachery. Bertie's efforts to recover the platter are to no avail, of course, because the other customer has it and has gone on his way. Swing is knocked out by a mysterious man searching his room (it was Bertie) and is invited to Vivian's place to recover. Vivian seems to have a slave named Sam, or at least a very obsequious Black servant and cook. Bertie hires a man to kill Swing, and has Mister Bluff (Swing's sidekick) taken hostage. The ransom note demands the silver plate, but Swing doesn't know what that's about. Swing is being held at gunpoint by the kidnappers when Pouik (Bluff's dog) brings him a pistol and joins the fray. Hibou (another sidekick) turns up as well, and Bluff is soon freed. The man with the platter knows its significance, and returns to ask Vivian for 200 guineas to prove her father's innocence. Bertie Wilkins gets to the man first, stabs him, and takes the platter. The man lives long enough to explain it to Vivian and Swing. Swing finds Wilkins trying to bury the platter, and the game is up. The Hopkins name is cleared, and Vivian is single again."

      "The D.A. knows that Windy Maner runs an extortion scheme, although he always manages to keep just within the law. Then one night in July 1948 a transaction goes wrong and a merchant is gunned down by a member of Windy's gang, at Windy's orders. The police quickly arrest the gunman, who is sentenced to death by electrocution. The gunman protests his innocence and makes an impassioned plea on the way to the electric chair, and the newspapers run the story. Windy sees his chance. The executed man was not the real killer, and not even a member of Windy's gang. Windy has the real killer write a confession and board a plane out of the country while Windy sends the confession and the murder weapon to the press, convinced that proof of a wrongful execution will disgrace the D.A. It seems to work, but the D.A. is wily. The execution was staged, the real killer was arrested as he boarded the plane, and Windy Maner's extortion racket has been shut down."

The first engagement has Superman ending up imprisoned in Luthor's war suit which is programmed to discharge red solar energy whenever its prisoner tries to break free. He tries to contact Jimmy but Jimmy refuses to believe that Superman is imprisoned and the suit reinforces that with a manufactured image of Luthor. It tries to kill Jimmy and then threatens to kill anyone else Superman tries to contact. However Superman has left a message burned in Kryptonese on the wall, which Jimmy deciphers. Next day another strange creature (Trogar) comes to challenge Superman and Superman has to face him looking like and sounding like Luthor. He makes it sound like Luthor is giving Superman a testimonial. This is to much for Luthor's vanity, and soon the battle suit disappears releasing Superman. Trogar turns out to have been Supergirl in disguise. Luthor isn't exactly unhappy because the battle suit has given him a wealth of information about his enemy's physiology which he hopes to use in the next meeting."
