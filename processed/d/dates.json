So when Saumitri discovers the pure gold sands of Suvarna Dweep, her pretentious owl tries to match the status of his friend the king of swans, and oversteps the boundaries of caution. The Panchatantra, though originally written by Pandit Vishnu Sharma, was reworked by successive writers. The stories in this Amar Chitra Katha are taken from the Kannada translation, of Vasubhaga Datta's version, by Durgasimha, a minister at the court of the Chalukya king, Jayasimha.\""
