The driver is taken aback to learn Carlos's full name: Carlos Arozamena Martínez. The man overpays Carlos for his lost newspapers, and asks for his address, because he has figured out that Carlos is his son. Meanwhile at home Isabel, the mother of Carlos, deals with a difficult customer, who insults her and takes the sewing she has done without paying. Carlos is outraged, but his mother is resigned to her fate. Then Carlos produces the money he has received from his father, and she accepts this fate also. Carlos Arozamena, Senior, lives in a mansion with his overbearing mother and servants. Memín is still grounded and has to stay home helping his mother all day."
