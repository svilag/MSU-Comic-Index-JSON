      "Summary: A group of Redcoats commanded by a Lieutenant Abbott stops at an inn where Bluff and Hibou are waiting to meet Cap'tain Swing. The innkeeper, Simeon, has had a run-in with the bad-tempered Abbott before, so he runs off when Bluff offers to play host. Abbott has a mysterious small chest with him that he seems to be guarding with exaggerated care. Hibou and Bluff are curious, so Hibou ties some pans to Pouik's tail to distract Abbott, and Bluff switches the contents of the chest for some stinky cheese. Meanwhile, a few miles away, Swing is talking to Madame Meyer, a lady from whom the British have just stolen a small chest of family jewels. Also her husband has been missing for three days. When Swing arrives at the inn the English soldiers have gone. He and Bluff look at the jewels and Swing sends Bluff and Hibou to return them to Madame Meyer and to look for her husband, while Swing continues on his previous mission for Dr. Strong. Another guest at the inn overhears and steals the jewels. Meanwhile the Governor has presented the box of stinky cheese to his wife as a gift, and Lt. Abbott is in deep trouble. Three days later Swing hears a troubador singing a ballad of Spartacus, and Swing asks the singer where he can find Spartacus. The singer says he might not even exist, but another audience member says to ask the Redcoats, who have been humiliated by Spartacus a thousand times. Swing meets Spartacus in a bar, goes to his hideout, and asks him for Dr. Strong to join an American attack on the British. Hibou and Bluff, thanks to Pouik's tracking ability, arrive at the hideout at the same time on the trail of the jewel thief. It turns out to be the wife of Spartacus who stole the jewels in order to buy arms for the resistance. It turns out also that Spartacus is just a bandit and he is also holding Mr. Meyer captive. Swing frees Meyer, returns the jewels, and kidnaps Spartacus for trial in an American tribunal."

A huge mechanical dragon is being used by the Japanese to devastate the village and intimidate the superstitious villagers. Ginny Mueller and the Blackhawks meet in the deserted village, and find Wu Cheng's diary. It describes the building of the dragon, with American aid, and Wu Cheng's efforts to stop it. Imprisoned by the Japanese, Wu Cheng learns that the Japanese attacked his village specifically to lure the Blackhawks there, as part of a bargain with Germany. Ginny's presence as a witness was also arranged by the Japanese. Wu Cheng gets free in time to reveal the set-up and save the day. He re-joins the Blackhawks team."
