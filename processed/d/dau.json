      "Summary (from OCLC): Shakespeare's tragedy of a royal father and his daughters is presented scene by scene in comic book format. As flies are to wanton boys, so are we to th' gods: they kill us for their sport, howls King Lear. In artist Ian Pollock's surreal interpretation of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, the abstract wail of \"the unaccomodated man\" is dramatized in subtle shadings of the old king's anguish. Every line of dialogue is preserved, and every scene is illustrated in full-color panels arranged on the page in comic book format. As Lear loses his crown, his daughters, his youth, and his dignity, Pollack's paintings keep pace, raising the tension to the level of live performance, and making the nuances of speech and action vividly clear. Pollack's rendition of King Lear is an invaluable aid to both veteran and potential Shakespeare readers."

Rocky Langford, age 16, is sent to bed without supper in a nearby orphanage, and decides to run away. Rocky soon rescues Lassie from some trigger-happy country folk, and they run away together. Rocky needs a job, but on his first try a sawmill boss knocks him out and steals Lassie. They recover and escape again, and hitch a ride with a friendly family that's relocating. The family helps Rocky get a job on a riverboat heading for New Orleans. In New Orleans, Rocky rescues a boy and gets a job at a boatyard with the boy's grateful guardian. Rocky learns the trade, gets his own sloop by fixing it up, and sails away with Lassie to see the world. A storm comes up, Lassie is washed overboard, and Rocky makes it to Jamaica with his boat half wrecked. Meanwhile Lassie has been rescued by Mr. Lawrence, a plantation owner, and his yacht, and his daughter Gerry. The yacht has come to Jamaica too, and Lassie finds Rocky. Mr. Lawrence offers Rocky a job as timekeeper on his coffee plantation, partly because he wants Gerry to have someone her own age nearby."

      "\"Simon Adams is certain of what he's not: he's not one of those dead-beat dads. He's a thoroughly modern, involved father. He'd give up anything for his daughter and to prove it, he's already sacrificed his career, his pride, and various portions of his sanity. But despite his deep love for his family, Simon is still human. Sometimes, despite the best of intentions, he still finds himself floating in the inky blackness of his own head. The conflict between his own goals and aspirations and the needs of his little girl sometimes leaves him lost and confused. Lucky for Simon, sometimes the little stars shine the brightest and he can always count on the light of his to lead him home.\"",

The effort is being coordinated by Deliah Darkthorne, or Low Valley as she now prefers to be called. Low has aged 40 years in the year and a half since teleporting at the end of the Passages album. She is the one who sent the note summoning Rork. Low doesn't understand what the \"event\" is going to be, only that a beam of light will come down from the sky and that it will have transformational powers. Low has placed experiments in the path of the beam, like a mouse, a cactus, and an apple. The beam comes, and things change, but the results aren't very comprehensible. Low takes Rork to another room and shows him her daughter, Sy-Ra, who is floating in the air stuck between worlds as Rork was near the end of \"Passages.\" Low wants Rork to take Sy-Ra to an astrologer to get her fixed up, and Rork agrees. Then Low eats the apple from the beam experiment, and seems to gain a new sense of well-being and extended perceptions. She tells Rork they'll meet again in nine months, at his house."

      "Summary: Télé awakes to a power failure with only his/her shadow for company. Télé follows a parade of prehistoric looking, Genet-quoting animal monsters, which joins a group of women truckdrivers and their trucks. A mysterious bodiless shadow is also following the parade. Télé is captured by the kamioneuses (or camioneuses). The truckdrivers are then set upon by a rival gang, the précieuses (or gracieuses), who drive smaller cars. While trying to escape in the confusion with a Proust-quoting monster, Télé is captured by the new gang, but freed by a kiss from the mysterious shadow. Télé flees with the monsters, pursued by both gangs while the city begins to flood. The monsters (quoting Robert Desnos) and Télé make it to a market in the suburbs for a good meal underwater, chewing their literature. The kamioneuses refuel and have a beer. Most of the rest of the story is underwater, with fish going by. Télé is captured by a band of rockeuses (or rockettes), and the animals flee. Both the kamioneuses and the gracieuses see the animals without Télé, and the camioneuses soon attack the rockettes, trying to retrieve Télé. The rockettes escape on their Vespas with a wounded Télé. Télé is left in the care of Garance, the dauphine of the rockettes, who wants to stay home and read comics anyhow. Her pile of comics includes Popeye, Spirou, Tintin and The Spirit. Garance takes Télé on a flying scooter ride, and they visit the Fairy of Domesticity. The fairy hooks Télé up to a futuramama machine and makes predictions. Télé's shadow asks the fairy's shadow about the mysterious shadow. The fairy makes a pay phone ring where the shadow is and she (with the animals quoting Robert Desnos again) is reunited with Télé's shadow. Télé leaves, with the animals quoting Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, to find the shadow's body. The three gangs declare peace. While Télé is still searching, the animals quote Lou Reed &amp; Philip K. Dick. Climbing above the water, Télé finds his/her true love stuck in another dimension, but crashes through to a happy ending.",
