      "(Kôdansha Komikkusu Kisu)",
      "Summary (by Katherine Pastor): Noda Megumi (\"Nodame\") is a piano prodigy who has no discipline and prefers to play by ear. By chance, she meets Shinichi Chiaki, the top student in the piano program of a prestigious music college in Japan. Nodame is immediately head over heels in love with Chiaki, but he takes much longer to warm up to her unique personality and quirks. The story follows both of their struggles to pursue their musical ambitions and eventual success. This multivolume manga series had been adapted into two television series (a live action and an animated series), as well as two live action movies and three video games. The Nodame character is based on an actual person of the same name. The main character is not shown with large eyes and curvilinear figures that are more conventional features of female characters in anime and manga."
