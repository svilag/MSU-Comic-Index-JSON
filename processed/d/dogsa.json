Unlike the crime lords who came before him, Julius rules the streets with a just and fair law. The people love him; the other families fear him and his power. Now they are considering what once would have been unthinkable: complete dissolution of the families' organizations in favor of a single leader. But not everyone is ready for this new world order. As the ides of March draw near, even some of his top lieutenants question Julius' growing power. Antony Johnston and Brett Weldele recreate Shakespeare's classic political thriller with a hard modern edge, bringing new relevance and poignancy to Julius Caesar.\""
