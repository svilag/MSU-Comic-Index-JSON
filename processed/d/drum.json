Infatuated with tracking down evidence of super-human activity, these mystery archaeologists of the late 20th Century uncover unknown paranormal secrets and histories, such as a World War II supercomputer that can access other universes, a ghostly spirit of vengeance, and a lost island of dying monsters. In this volume, the team encounters an abandoned alien spacecraft, but will the heroes beat their rival, Jacob Greene of the villainous \"Four,\" to the ship? Then, Elijah Snow begins to pull back from his allies, acting increasingly in secret. Will he be able to draw the last of the Four out of hiding, and can he act before his teammates lose their faith in him?"

      "Summary: Mickey gets a package from West Africa, and inside is a young African named Thursday. In the funny-animal universe of Mickey Mouse, where everyone is some kind of anthropomorphic animal, Thursday is the opposite, an \"animalized\" human. He is a trickster, interested only in food and fun, and quite a difficult house guest. Only Goofy can calm him down, and it develops as a kind of punch line to the story that Goofy closely resembles a sacred totem pole from West Africa. Toward the end of the story Thursday won't stop playing a drum, and Mickey tries to get rid of him by giving him to an African American jazz band, Cal Cabaway's Congoliers. The band, drawn as dark-skinned dogs, rejects Thursday because they can't get him to stop drumming. It turns out that the drumming was a message to his brother in Africa requesting shipment of his pet elephant. When the elephant arrives things get even crazier. Eventually, though, Thursday leaves on his own because the people in Mickey's country aren't letting him have enough fun."

Ernestillo says that if his father can see his wife and talk to her when he's drunk, he wants to do it too and talk to his mother. When the boys take the bottle from him, Ernestillo attacks with a hammer and manages to knock himself out. His friends put him in his bed, and return to school. The teacher wants to know what they found, and they say Ernestillo wasn't home. The teacher doesn't believe them, and questions them until he gets the truth. The teacher rushes to the carpentry shop, sees Ernestillo unconscious, and calls an ambulance. The boys wait at the hospital while the teacher looks for Mr. Vargas, the missing father of Ernestillo. The news that his son is in the Red Cross hospital shocks Mr. Vargas, and hearing that Ernestillo was trying to see his mother fills him with shame. In the hospital, Ernestillo recovers. The teacher brings Mr. Vargas to his son, and he begs his son's forgiveness."

      "SUMMARY: Carlos, Ricardo and Ernesto eat in a Chinese restaurant. Memín goes home to get some maracas, figuring that no cabaret will let them in because they are so young. Memín plans to pretend they are musicians. The white boys sing, however badly, and Memín holds it together with his natural rhythm. Meanwhile, Carlos's mother Isabel (\"Chabela\") is in a tough underworld cabaret talking about how she hates her life and how her husband abandoned her when he got rich, though Carlos doesn't know this. Eventually the four friends arrive at the same establishment and find Chabela fighting off a drunk customer. The man hits her and Carlos wades in, knocking him down. The man pulls a gun and tries to shoot Carlos, but Isabel gets between them and is shot. Carlos throws a bottle and apparently kills the man. Isabel is not badly hurt and tells her son to run before the police get there."

Since narrowly avoiding jail time, Peter's lived a lonely life in a tiny apartment, with a menial job he hates. Things look like they might turn around when, looking for a late-night snack, Peter wanders into a café and meets Angela. She shows him the Archives, where books currently being written are somehow on the shelves. It's a book-lover's dream until the black marketer who ruined Peter's life returns with a grudge. On the run, will Peter find salvation in the Archives, or further ruin?\""
