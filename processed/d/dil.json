Morris says that Hergé's Tintin in the Land of the Soviets was important to him in choosing comics as his career. He speaks briefly of censorship, merchandising, animation, stage adaptation, and film adaptation of Lucky Luke. La Diligence, he says, is a parody of the film Stagecoach. Morris describes his way of depicting motion, and a gangster strip called Fred le Savant, that he did briefly with Goscinny. Includes two photographs of Morris, and a sample page of Fred le Savant."
