Then he has to let them throw him in the school's rooftop cistern. This is accomplished, but Ricardo can't get himself out of the cistern, sinks to the bottom, and drowns. Carlos pulls him out, and he seems dead, but he's not, quite. The teacher hears the commotion, takes Ricardo to the school doctor, and covers for the boys with the administration. At home Ricardo's mother insists that they move him to a new school. In a private talk with his father Ricardo explains everything, says he deserved his punishment, and wants to stay in the public school. The father understands because he wasn't always rich, and makes up a story to calm his wife. Things go better at school among the boys, and after a few days Ricardo dismisses his chauffeur so he can play baseball in an alley. Since it's a dirty place Ricardo takes his shoes off, and Memín guards them. Some bigger boys come along and want to use the area for their own game, and a fistfight starts. During the confusion a thief picks up Ricardo's shoes."

Kent thinks there must be a pattern which would include his encounter with a space ship the day before in which the ship disappeared. The Thief-Master is from a race in which criminal tendencies had been bred out generations before but he is a genetic atavism. He refuses to consult his family because the shame to them but the Healer thinks of a plan. Superman is unable to stop the next theft, of selenium, and meets the thief only to have him escape but gets a clue to where the thief will strike next: Molybdenum. He sets a successful trap and the thief's entire demeanor changes. The doctor's theory was that the genetic compulsion would end if he were captured against his will."

Justin leads him through the sewers. Evidently Superman also suffers from paranoia and turns on Justin who has found refuge for him in the Superman museum. Justin is saved from the fellow by the real Superman who reveals that the man is an escaped mental patient and the marauders were doctors. His mania is believing he is a reincarnation of Superman.
