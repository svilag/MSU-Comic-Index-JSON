Posing as an exotic dancer she captures his men while they're off-duty in Katung, and drops one of them back at the base, dead but with a letter attached. Captain Wings is instructed to exchange himself for the rest of the men. It's a trap, at a temple in the country, but Captain Wings goes anyhow. Just as the men are about to be cremated alive in Prince Yuima-Koji's plane, Griper shows up, kills Madam Dragon and blows up the temple."

A Japanese Zero crash-lands near the base, and a woman survives, managing to make the men think they've captured secret plans. After the squadron has left to take advantage of the plans, the woman steals a gun and kills the radio operator. The crew of Madam X figures out what has happened, and leaves sick bay in a suicide mission to spring the ambush the Japanese have set up. On page 7, a Japanese radioman says, \"Silver disks",
      "our greatest arsenal gone! Shoot down that plane at any cost!\" The whiz-bomb shown in p. 1 does seem to be disc-shaped, though from the title and cover art we would expect flying saucer UFOs."

A huge mechanical dragon is being used by the Japanese to devastate the village and intimidate the superstitious villagers. Ginny Mueller and the Blackhawks meet in the deserted village, and find Wu Cheng's diary. It describes the building of the dragon, with American aid, and Wu Cheng's efforts to stop it. Imprisoned by the Japanese, Wu Cheng learns that the Japanese attacked his village specifically to lure the Blackhawks there, as part of a bargain with Germany. Ginny's presence as a witness was also arranged by the Japanese. Wu Cheng gets free in time to reveal the set-up and save the day. He re-joins the Blackhawks team."

      "Though the art is substantially the same, this story is a thorough re-write of the Captain Wings story in Wings Comics, no. 53 (Jan. 1945), where it is signed \"L. Elias.\"",
      "Summary: \"Madam X\" is a grounded bomber upon which \"whiz-bombs\" have been inappropriately mounted. It has been damaged and its crew is injured, and the plane is scheduled to be dismantled. A Japanese Zero crash-lands near the base, and a woman survives, managing to make the men think they've captured secret plans. After the squadron has left to take advantage of the plans, the woman steals a gun and kills the radio operator. The crew of Madam X figures out what has happened, and leaves sick bay in a suicide mission to spring the ambush the Japanese have set up. On page 7, a Japanese radioman says, \"Silver disks",
      "our greatest arsenal gone! Shoot down that plane at any cost!\" The whiz-bomb shown in p. 1 does seem to be disc-shaped, though from the title and cover art we would expect flying saucer UFOs."
