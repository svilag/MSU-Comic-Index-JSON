      "Summary: The story opens at \"Terre BrulÃ©e,\" the ranch of Giddap Joe. An Indian boy named Wa Wa is hauling water for the horses when he comes upon White Deer, a girl who brings a warning. The white man in the blue mountains must leave, she says, or he will be killed. There are only 15 days until winter snow is expected. Joe takes the warning seriously, and rides up into the mountains to look for the man. The man turns out to be Bruce Altman, an old friend. It starts to snow early, and the two are stuck in Altman's cabin for the winter. Altman's story is that he was out hunting with his young son Tom, six years earlier, when Tom saw an Indian, panicked, and killed her. She was out picking berries. Bruce told Tom never to admit he did it, and Bruce took the blame for the crime himself. The incident led to the killing of two other white families by the Indians. The people of the town, Lone Pine, were about to lynch Bruce as the cause of the Indian attacks, so he went into hiding. Unbeknownst to Bruce, Tom has stood up in church and told the truth within the past year, to clear his father's name. The brother of the dead girl is still hunting Bruce, but Giddap intercedes and explains the situation to the brother. Bruce goes home."

      "Summary: Johnny leaves his patrol when Tex spots an unknown Mustang about to be ambushed by a Messerschmitt. It turns out the Mustang pilot didn't need help, but when Johnny returns to his flight it's surrounded by German fighters. Johnny's unexpected return saves the day, and back at the base the new pilot reports. His name is Lt. Tom Talon, and like Cloud he is Native American. The other pilots observe the meeting of the two men with these comments: \"Look at the dead-pan way those two are looking at each other!\" \"Just like Indians! Never showing what they feel!\" We learn that as boys the two men played together on the reservation, and that Talon's brother died during one of their games and Cloud is unfairly blamed for the death. Talon has sworn to kill Cloud, though the other men don't know this. On the next mission Johnny Cloud makes Talon his wingman, demoting a disapproving Tex to no. 3. Talon saves Cloud's life after first putting it in jeopardy. The next day Cloud saves Talon's life nearly at the expense of his own, and lands barely alive in enemy territory. Talon lands to pick him up, and they make it to safety even though being fired upon by a German tank. Talon considers the fact that Cloud saved his life to be payment of the debt for his brother's life.",
