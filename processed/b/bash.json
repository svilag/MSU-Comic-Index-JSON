Nylon Road is a window into the soul of a culture that we are still struggling to understand. Beautifully told, poignant, this is a powerful work about the necessity of freedom."

      "Summary (from SkyRiver): In Beirut in September 1982, while Israeli soldiers secured the area, a Christian militia entered the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila and massacred hundreds, if not thousands, of Palestinians. Ari Folman was one of those Israeli soldiers, but for more than twenty years he remembered nothing of that night. Then came a friend's disturbing dream and with it Folman's need to excavate the truth of the war in Lebanon and answer the crucial question: What was he doing during the hours of slaughter at Sabra and Shatila? Stunningly original in form, Waltz with Bashir follows Folman's journey deep into the darkness of Beirut. Drawing on the stories of other soldiers and his own returning fragments of memory, Folman painfully and candidly pieces together the war and his place in it: the senselessness of the soldiers' orders; the fear that pervades every moment; the casual bloodshed of civilians, culminating in the massacres themselves. The result is a graphic novel that is as damning as it is beautiful. An indictment of violence of extraordinary power."

Driven by a centuries-old hatred, each clan will do anything to annihilate the other. The Kouga clan is engaging in a little espionage, and has planted a shapeshifter, disguised as an Iga ninja, in the Iga palace. Meanwhile the Iga clan turns to its last, best hope: their new leader, Gennosuke, the only one who can defeat the formidable Kouga leader, Oboro. But is she willing to kill the man she loves? As the war grows more desperate, will true love be the next casualty?",

A highlight of the series, and the inspiration for one of the segments of the blockbuster Sin City film, That Yellow Bastard returns in a newly redesigned edition, with a brand-new cover by Miller - some of his first comics art in years! The worst thing to be in Basin City is an honest cop, but it's Hartigan's last day on the job, and he plans to go out with a bang. Little Nancy Callahan, age eleven, has been kidnapped by a psycho who likes to hear children scream, and Hartigan's going to find her no matter what it takes. Hell of a way to start retirement."

His protagonist, Glenn Ganges, has conversations about dish soap and library visits that are both faithful depictions of mundane interactions and existential dissections of the units that construct our lives. Huizenga has an understated, quiet approach to story writing that allows his characters (and his readers) the self-awareness to recognize the humor and tragedy of every moment. Huizenga's much-lauded work is finely detailed, and in its innovative use of form, it explores the boundaries of the comic medium, deconstructing and reconstructing panels to express temporality and livid experience more fully. Presented in this expanded edition, Gloriana employs familiar settings and thorough, sometimes scientific explanations to reach thoughtful conclusions.\""

Pru Basketball of the Basketball family asks for Shermlock's help, because her uncle Coolidge Basketball has died mysteriously. Shermlock leaves Whatsit at Basketball Hall to be the woman's bodyguard and pretends to go away. The hound of the Basketballs turns out to be a neighbor's dog searching for Red-Heart dog food, which Pru keeps in her room. The uncle died because he thought the dog's howling proved the reality of a legendary Devil's curse, and Pru knew he had a heart condition and wanted to inherit.
