      "\"Abstract: Monsters are no rarity in the history of U.S.-American comics, but in Ken Dahl's eponymous small press comic they assume a particular function. His morphing monsters tell a story about how being a carrier of the herpes virus leads to incessant worry and social isolation. Dahl's narrative exposes the instability of the body's boundaries, and that of the distinction between illness and health. This chapter reads Monsters through traditions and theorizations of the Monstrous and Grotesque, as well as cultural histories of medicine that have shed light on discourses of contagion and (in-)visibility of illness. It is the idiosyncracies of the comics medium and its history, and those of Dahl's stylistic choices, that enable a particularly tangible representation of social and personal illness experience.\""

      "Summary (from OCLC): It's coming up to Hallowe'en at Chilblain Hall, and that means that Glister's father is already putting up the Christmas decorations and rehearsing the Wassailers. To make matters worse, boundary changes mean Fairyland and Whixleyshire's borders meet right outside Glister's front door. Strange things happen and long lost loved ones return from who knows where. It's up to Glister to cross over into Faerie territory to retrieve her mother, but her greatest challenge will be finding her way home again."

He is followed by two Bernardelli Insurance Society employees to minimize the damage that tends to follow him as he tries to use non-lethal force while saving lives as bounty hunters come after him. The bounty hunters destroy cities and towns in the process of capturing Vash. The stylistic features of the images of female characters are a mixture. One is drawn small and petite, not unlike a typical Japanese woman. Another is drawn as having a large build and tall, resembling a stereotypical American male."

Taking to the roads of the American Southwest, he encounters the aged and sophisticated Diego de la Vega. Django is fascinated by this unusual character, the first wealthy white man he's met who seems totally unconcerned with the color of his skin, and who can hold his own in a fight. Django hires on as Diego's bodyguard, and is soon drawn into a fight to free the local indigenous people from brutal servitude. Learning much from the older man, he discovers that slavery isn't exclusive to his people, as he even dons the mask of Zorro in their mission of mercy!"
