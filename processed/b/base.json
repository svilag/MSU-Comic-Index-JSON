      "SUMMARY: Since Ricardo wants to be part of the gang the other boys arrange an initiation. First Ricardo has to carry each of them on his back like a horse. Then he has to let them throw him in the school's rooftop cistern. This is accomplished, but Ricardo can't get himself out of the cistern, sinks to the bottom, and drowns. Carlos pulls him out, and he seems dead, but he's not, quite. The teacher hears the commotion, takes Ricardo to the school doctor, and covers for the boys with the administration. At home Ricardo's mother insists that they move him to a new school. In a private talk with his father Ricardo explains everything, says he deserved his punishment, and wants to stay in the public school. The father understands because he wasn't always rich, and makes up a story to calm his wife. Things go better at school among the boys, and after a few days Ricardo dismisses his chauffeur so he can play baseball in an alley. Since it's a dirty place Ricardo takes his shoes off, and Memín guards them. Some bigger boys come along and want to use the area for their own game, and a fistfight starts. During the confusion a thief picks up Ricardo's shoes."

She pretends to go out all night to a cabaret and come home drunk at dawn. This, she seems to be hoping, will convince Carlos to take his rich father's offer and move into the mansion. Carlos is beside himself to think his mother has gone back to her old profession, and pleads with her to continue doing laundry for people. She says they'll talk about it later, and that for now he should just get out of her way. Carlos goes to play baseball with his friends, and Memín can tell he's upset behind his smile. Memín hits a one-handed home run by imitating the tennis player Pelón Ozuna."

      "SUMMARY: On the first day of public school some of the boys are introduced. Carlos Arozamena (Carlangas) has curly hair and is tough and full of mischief. Ricardo Arcaraz (Ricardito) is a stuck-up rich boy with blonde hair and glasses, the son of a diplomat. Guillermo Manquín (Memín) is the only black boy in the class, and his introduction brings derogatory racial remarks from the other boys. Ernesto Vargas (Ernestillo) is very smart, but poor, and comes to school without shoes. Carlos and Ricardo get into a fistfight. Because of his attitude towards his other classmates, the teacher recommends that Ricardo find another school, and Memín cheers. The teacher gives Memín a lecture about equal opportunity. On the way home from school Memín makes friends with Carlos and Ernesto, and warns Carlos that Ricardo's father is planning to complain about the fight. At home, Memín helps his mother with laundry, and Ernesto helps his father finish some furniture. Carlos goes home, where his mother is sleeping because she works the night shift. Ricardo goes home and hears his mother threaten his classmates when she sees his black eye, but Ricardo says he got it playing a game and doesn't complain. Back at school, Ricardo is excluded from the baseball game, and finally asks to play. Because he wants to take charge of the game, the other boys reject him."
