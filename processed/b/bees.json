The Society divides up: \"They have to make six individuals overcome their handicaps, as well as overcome six crimes.\" The story ends with a pledge, and a list of \"great people who made their mark in spite of physical handicaps:\" Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Helen Keller, Milton, Demosthenes, and Beethoven.",
