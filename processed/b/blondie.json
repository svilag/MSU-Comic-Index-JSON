She sends Daisy the dog to wake the children while she hustles Dagwood along. After a frantic flurry of activity, Dagwood and the children leave for work and school. Suddenly, Daisy and Blondie notice the newspaper on the stoop. It's Sunday! \"Be brave, Daisy,\" Blondie murmurs as they clutch each other in nervous apprehension while Dagwood and the kids storm furiously back into the house."
