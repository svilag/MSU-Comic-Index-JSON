      "Summary (by Amy Lazet): A mysterious man who is being chased tosses Bugs Bunny a vial of liquid and tells him to guard it with his life. As Bugs is telling Porky Pig about it the next day, a policeman tells them that Bugs' mysterious man is Professor Bimbloke, a scientist who claims to have discovered the Fountain of Youth, and he is missing. Bugs and Porky accidentally drop the bottle and a rooster drinks it, and promptly turns into a chick. The chick waddles off to Elmer Fudd's home with Bugs and Porky following, and they realize that the Fountain is in Elmer's back yard. Meanwhile the villains have gotten the location of the fountain out of the professor. One comes back to steal the water, but Bugs throws some on him and turns him into an innocent juvenile, who happily leads them to the professor. After the villains are arrested, Bugs, and Elmer and the professor return to bottle the water, but the fountain has gone dry. Petunia had a bottle of the water, but before she drank from the bottle she refilled it with fresh water."
