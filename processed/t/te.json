      "SUMMARY: Since Ricardo wants to be part of the gang the other boys arrange an initiation. First Ricardo has to carry each of them on his back like a horse. Then he has to let them throw him in the school's rooftop cistern. This is accomplished, but Ricardo can't get himself out of the cistern, sinks to the bottom, and drowns. Carlos pulls him out, and he seems dead, but he's not, quite. The teacher hears the commotion, takes Ricardo to the school doctor, and covers for the boys with the administration. At home Ricardo's mother insists that they move him to a new school. In a private talk with his father Ricardo explains everything, says he deserved his punishment, and wants to stay in the public school. The father understands because he wasn't always rich, and makes up a story to calm his wife. Things go better at school among the boys, and after a few days Ricardo dismisses his chauffeur so he can play baseball in an alley. Since it's a dirty place Ricardo takes his shoes off, and Memín guards them. Some bigger boys come along and want to use the area for their own game, and a fistfight starts. During the confusion a thief picks up Ricardo's shoes."

Ricardo's mother is frantic and fainting, and his father beats him savagely with his belt, but after an explanation the father is proud of his son. He asks Ricardo not to tell his mother about the beating, and Ricardo agrees. Memín's mother sends him out for milk, and he sees pictures of Carlos and his mother in the newspaper. Carlos has been arrested for murder, and sent to the house of correction. Everyone's first thought is that Ricardo's father might be able to help Carlos, but that seems not to be the case. The boys decide to ask their teacher."
