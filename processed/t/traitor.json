A rival gang drugs him and throws him into Lake Michigan, but he wakes up. Many of Chicago's criminals are arrested, but Tintin pursues Bobby Smiles out west, where he and Snowy meet cowboys and Indians, strike oil, and get in a train wreck, a prairie fire, and get captured by a lynch mob. Smiles is captured, but then back in Chicago Snowy is kidnapped, and rescued, and a capitalist tries to grind both of them into corned beef, but a strike stops the factory. Tintin is kidnapped again from a banquet celebrating the victory over crime, dumped again in Lake Michigan tied to 400-pound dumbbells, which turn out to be made of wood. 355 suspects are then arrested, and Chicago's underworld is out of business.",

      "The author's dedication (to Jacques Lob) includes the information that this album \"should have become a film,\" and uses an ending written with Benjamin Legrand for the film \"Kazhann\" (1987).",
      "SUMMARY: The ruling Blue Barons of the planet Kazhann are plunderers whose religion is art. The Superior Shaan orders the remains of the rebel Sloan uncovered and brought to him. A woman penetrates the train transporting the corpse, and revives Sloane. Sloane vows to vanquish the Emperor. The woman says her name is Legend, mistress of the \"Guild of Voice,\" a singer. Legend saves Sloane from madness. She explains that the funeral train they are riding is the Emperor's mental projection of Mozart's Requiem, and that she got in by knowing codes and songs taught to her by her father. The Blue Barons learn that Sloane is alive, and determine to help him by rebelling against the Emperor Shaan. One of the Barons' warriors, named Vuzz, salutes Sloane and pledges his aid. Shaan attacks, and reveals that he is what Sloane himself will become after 300 years. Sloane denies this, and says there are alternate futures. Legend attacks, and the evil is defeated. The Blue Barons present Sloane with his reconstructed ship, O Siddharta. Sloane is reunited with Vuzz and Yearl."

      "Summary: Arriving in Calcutta by train, Indy reports to a colonial policeman named Blake that a traveling companion was attacked by thugs, and he saved her. She is a dancer, named Kamala. Indy meets up with reporter Marya Smirnova, who tells him she has information about a lost temple. That night they go to Kamala's performance, and while they're walking her to the hotel she is kidnapped by Thugs. Indy tells the story of the Thugs, a cult of Kali now apparently revived after a century of dormancy. When Indy and Marya arrive at Bhubaneshwar to look for the temple and Kamala, Marya is met at the train by the Rolls-Royce of the Maharajah, who turns out to be an old chum of Marya's named Sardar. They are invited to be guests at his palace. That evening just outside the palace they hear a speech by Mahatma Gandhi, who is organizing to resist the British government. On a tiger hunt the next day Jones falls off his elephant and kills a tiger right away, and finds that the tiger was guarding a cave leading to the temple. That night Indy and Marya sneak in and see Kamala in chains, and hear the announcement of her sacrifice to Kali the next day. On the way out they lose their way and find a cave of lepers, who try to escape, but Indy locks them back in. Next day Marya figures out that Sardar is the chief of the Thugs, and that night they sneak into the temple ceremony in disguise. Kamala is made to dance before her death, and Indy grabs her just in time, while Marya grabs a big ruby from Kali's statue. They discover that the colonial policeman from Calcutta is one of the Thugs. To help them in their escape, Indy releases the lepers. Once outside the cave, Kamala grabs the ruby and throws it back in, whereupon the cave collapses. She explains that she is a priestess of Kali, chosen since birth by the Thugs for this sacrifice. She had tried to flee, but the policeman, Blake, brought her back. Blake, the son of an Englishman and Indian woman, felt rejected by both communities and revived the Thugs as revenge to start an uprising against the British and to sabotage Gandhi's movement."
