      "Summary: A man comes to a pawnshop in the \"theatrical district\" to retrieve a \"theatrical trunk\" that he left nearly two years ago. The pawnbroker has sold it already, and so is murdered by the man. Doll Man and Doll Girl arrive, and the man calls himself The Adder, as he escapes using acrobatic and knife-throwing skills. The Adder finds the trunk in a junkyard, and the junk dealer recognizes him as a former vaudeville performer with a knife act. The Adder had been a robber, and was hiding because of a murder accusation, but his loot was sewn into the lining of the trunk. He manages to catch Doll Man and Doll Girl when they arrive in pursuit. He puts them in the trunk, and sinks them over the side of a motorboat. Our heroes escape (\"Houdini himself couldn't have done it better\"), and arrest The Adder, who later dies in the electric chair according to a newspaper headline shown in the final panel.",
