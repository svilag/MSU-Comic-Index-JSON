      "Summary: Supplies are low at Fort Ontario, so Swing, Mister Bluff and Hibou Lugubre head for town to see their supplier, Judge Davenport. On the way they find at least four freight wagons destroyed, and they assume the wagons had contained food for the fort. Another traveler passing by says it was done by the Bishop brothers, who for some reason only attack shipments owned by Davenport. While Swing talks to Judge Davenport, Bluff and Hibou try to get food from Davenport's cook. Unfortunately Bluff has brought his dog Pouik along. Pouik chases a cat, trips the cook, and steals a sausage. The men never get fed, which supplies a comedic subplot to the story. A young woman named Judith Plummer is working for Davenport, who says he took her in because the Bishop brothers killed her mother. One of the Bishops, Andrew, is captured, and both Swing and Judith seem to recognize him. Swing realizes he owes the man for saving his life, though he never knew his name. Judith, we discover, is in love with Andrew and they were engaged to be married before her mother died. Davenport sentences Andrew to die the next morning, so Swing breaks him out of the lockup in the night. This leads to the unraveling of Davenport's schemes. Actually it was \"Judge\" Davenport who killed Mrs. Plummer and the father of the Bishop boys. Davenport framed the Bishops to get control of their freight business. Finally Davenport sends a wagon full of English soldiers to Fort Ontario to try to capture it. The Fort is warned on time, but Davenport is shown to be a traitor as well as an assassin and a thief. With Davenport dead and the English routed, Andrew and Judith will marry and the transport business will be back in the hands of the Bishop family."

      "Summary: Eighteen year old Prince Zwanna enrolls at BASU (Black American State University), where his brother King Siafa has sent him for his royal education. At registration he meets a classmate named Stefani Stoul, and in class the next day he asks her out. Another classmate hears Zwanna's definition of ethics in class (\"we kill our enemies\"), and reports Zwanna to Wilma Femse, chief of the Focal Spy Company (FSC). FCS is apparently part of an international conspiracy that King Siafra warned him Zwanna about. The other three agents of FSC are called the Black Widows, named Georgina Shrubs, Rhoda Rayban, and Jamie Carter. All four are white transvestites. That night Zwanna's \"Zulu sense\" wakes him and he rushes out to find three white thugs beating up a black couple. One thung has a Hitler moustache, one has a swastika tattoo, and one wears a Confederate flag. All three are skinheads. Zwanna shouts the word \"Zhaab!\" and is transformed into a near-naked warrior with a spear and necklaces. The thugs are quickly killed. In the office of the Black Widows, the four transvestites make plans to catch Zwanna, focusing on his radicalism and his sexuality. In an office closet they have the corpse of W.R. Tolbert of Liberia. Soon Zwanna is kidnapped and chained for their admiration, and Stefani is brought out and threatened. This is too much, Stefani faints, and Zwanna shouts \"Zhaab!\" This gives him the power to rip the chains from the concrete and kill three of the transvestites. He then shouts \"Chaka!\" which enables him to leap ahead of the final transvestite and kill him. Zwanna picks up the unconscious Stefani and heads for home."
