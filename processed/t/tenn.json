The story weaves through the surreal and the painfully factual, guided by the careful, somber colors and inventive pacing unique to Hornschmeier's storytelling. Mother, Come Home extracts almost tangible drama from the most tranquil of moments, making that which is unspoken in each panel easily audible, and almost uncomfortably experienced."

She pretends to go out all night to a cabaret and come home drunk at dawn. This, she seems to be hoping, will convince Carlos to take his rich father's offer and move into the mansion. Carlos is beside himself to think his mother has gone back to her old profession, and pleads with her to continue doing laundry for people. She says they'll talk about it later, and that for now he should just get out of her way. Carlos goes to play baseball with his friends, and Memín can tell he's upset behind his smile. Memín hits a one-handed home run by imitating the tennis player Pelón Ozuna."
