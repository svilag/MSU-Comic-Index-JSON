      "Summary: Near the town of Nugget Gulch, Lucky Luke meets a bearded man who calls himself John the Philanthropist. John says he's a peaceful man, and that the notches on his revolver aren't his, because he just found it and doesn't really use it well. When a cobra comes from behind a rock and John draws and kills it in one swift motion, Lucky Luke has to wonder about his story. In Nugget Gulch a horse race is planned for the next day. Since John and Lucky Luke are both low on money, they both decide to enter. John has seen Jolly Jumper run, and knows he can't beat such a horse, but he enters the race anywhow. Betting is heavy on the race, and a series of colorful charcters are entered, including a Mexican rider named \"Pedro Nice Chink\" riding a mule named \"Flower of the Orient,\" and a overweight man called \"Texas Slim.\" When Lucky Luke goes to get Jolly Jumper for the race, he finds the horse missing. The race starts without Lucky Luke. John the Philanthropist's horse is black, until a rain shower washes the stain off and the stolen Jolly Jumper is revealed. Lucky Luke whistles, and Jolly Jumper dumps John into a rain barrel. Lucky Luke and Jolly Jumper are win the race together, inspired by an electric shock after a collision with a telegraph pole. John steals all the money and runs for it on his own horse. Lucky Luke telegraphs ahead to Rattlesnake Valley, and has \"poison\" signs put on all the water holes in the desert. John is soon crazy with thirst and easily caught. Lucky Luke has him shaved and he turns out to be the wanted outlaw Joe La-Gâchette."
