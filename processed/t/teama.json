The Angle is a crook who always has a surprise idea, an \"angle,\" to avoid capture. Darrel gets arrested, but sneaks out as Doll Man to work on the case. Hackie Joe Bilber remembers where he dropped their man off, at a hideout where his pal Small-Time is waiting. Doll Man hides and watches while established gangsters Boxy and Shoulders offer to cooperate with them. Doll Man squirts seltzer at Boxy and Shoulders, which starts a brawl. Meanwhile the police have decided that Darrel Dane is The Angle, so when Doll Man's phone call comes in they think they know who to look for. The police try to arrest Dane, and use tear gas, but Darrel changes back to Doll Man. Things get sorted out, and the new \"crime combine\" has been prevented.",
