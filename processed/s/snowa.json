Featuring sequences illustrated by Charles Vess, Brian Bolland, John Bolton, Michael Wm. Kaluta, James Jean, Mark Buckingham, Jill Thompson and more, 1,001 Nights of Snowfall is both an entry point to the critically acclaimed series and an essential part of Willingham's enchanting and imaginative Fables mythos. Traveling in Arabia as an Ambassador from the exiled Fables community, Snow White is captured by the local sultan who wants to marry her (and then kill her). But the clever Snow attempts to charm the sultan instead by playing Scheherazade, telling him fantastic stories for a total of 1,001 nights. Running the gamut from horror to dark intrigue to mercurial coming-of-age, Fables: 1,001 Nights of Snowfall reveals the secret histories of familiar Fables characters through a series of compelling and visually illustrative tales.\""

A rival gang drugs him and throws him into Lake Michigan, but he wakes up. Many of Chicago's criminals are arrested, but Tintin pursues Bobby Smiles out west, where he and Snowy meet cowboys and Indians, strike oil, and get in a train wreck, a prairie fire, and get captured by a lynch mob. Smiles is captured, but then back in Chicago Snowy is kidnapped, and rescued, and a capitalist tries to grind both of them into corned beef, but a strike stops the factory. Tintin is kidnapped again from a banquet celebrating the victory over crime, dumped again in Lake Michigan tied to 400-pound dumbbells, which turn out to be made of wood. 355 suspects are then arrested, and Chicago's underworld is out of business.",

One is Orion Assante, a man determined to expose the Pope for who he really is. The other is a mysterious figure wearing the all-too-familiar face of Grendel!\""

      "Summary (from OCLC): Matthew Scudder is dying, one bottle at a time. A young prostitute named Kim Dakkinen is dying too, her life measured out in tricks. She wanted out, had asked for Scudder's help, but suddenly she wasn't dying anymore, she was just dead. The former cop turned P.I. promised to protect her, but he failed. Now his atonement is to find her killer. But the secrets in the dead hooker's past are dirtier than her living, and searching for a killer in a city where everyone's a victim is a good way to make the role permanent. Steeped in traditional pulp, Block's writing has a true gift for capturing the art of conversation between his characters. These are the lowlifes of society, for whom Block occasionally finds redemption, but who are more often among the vilest beings in human existence. Snyder's art both encapsulates and elevates these rough-cut gems in a graphic, grainy, and moody setting that evokes the dark, noir magazine covers of the period."
