At the Baron's castle Robin joins the Baron at dinner, dumps soup on the Baron's head, and gets locked up. The Baron organizes a tournament in Elena's honor, and Robin sneaks out of his cell, steals a suit of armor, and beats the Baron in jousting. The prize that Elena has asked for is freedom for Robin and Little John, so De Luce must deliver."

      "Summary (from amazon via OCLC): \"The primacy of words over images has deep roots in Western culture. But what if the two are inextricably linked, equal partners in meaning-making? Written and drawn entirely as comics, Unflattening is an experiment in visual thinking. Nick Sousanis defies conventional forms of scholarly discourse to offer readers both a stunning work of graphic art and a serious inquiry into the ways humans construct knowledge. 'Unflattening' is an insurrection against the fixed viewpoint. Weaving together diverse ways of seeing drawn from science, philosophy, art, literature, and mythology, it uses the collage-like capacity of comics to show that perception is always an active process of incorporating and reevaluating different vantage points. While its vibrant, constantly morphing images occasionally serve as illustrations of text, they more often connect in nonlinear fashion to other visual references throughout the book. They become allusions, allegories, and motifs, pitting realism against abstraction and making us aware that more meets the eye than is presented on the page.\"",
