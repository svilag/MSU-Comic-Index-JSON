He is called into an alley by Superman asking for help, and he thinks that he might be able to take the man to a nearby shelter when they see a craft manned by marauders from the future who have sapped Superman's powers. Justin leads him through the sewers. Evidently Superman also suffers from paranoia and turns on Justin who has found refuge for him in the Superman museum. Justin is saved from the fellow by the real Superman who reveals that the man is an escaped mental patient and the marauders were doctors. His mania is believing he is a reincarnation of Superman. He used advanced technology to make the simulation more believable."

He is hoping to find something at the site of a UFO landing, but loses his footing and is injured. An alien heals him and explains that his ship is normally invisible. Nyxly repays the alien by knocking him out and taking his ship. The first encounter goes badly for Superman, who leaves and shows up catatonic in the WGBS Building. The alien arrives and begins treatment for a brain short circuit. Nyxly raises havok and Jimmy gets an idea from the alien's comment that Superman would be in a suggestible state until he has healed. They give Superman a remote earpiece and Jimmy directs Superman's assault, followed by Lois, then by Edge. After the battle the alien diagnoses the problem as Kryptonian Sleeping Sickness, against which he was never vaccinated because he left Krypton before it was scheduled."

On his fourteenth birthday, he comes down with a 'condition' that has plagued the men in his family for three hundred years. When he sees his crush, Risa, he transforms into his alter ego, the phantom thief Dark Mousy. Unfortunately, when Dark Mousy sees his crush, Risa's twin Riku, he transforms back into Daisuke.
