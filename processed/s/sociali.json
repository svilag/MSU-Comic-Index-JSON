      "in a corrupt stranglehold on the city. Peter Parker came of age during this time of struggle and hardship. Raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, two stemwinding Socialists committed to positive change for the people, Peter would have been a boyish beacon of optimism in any other era. But in this world of noir, he was an embittered, angry young man in search of justice. And then along came a spider. After a fated meeting with a mystical arachnid and its life-changing bite, he may have just inherited the force to honor the phrase, 'If those in power can't be trusted, it's the responsibility of the people to remove them'.\""

      "Summary (from SkyRiver): \"Mit dose kids, society is nix!\" So said the Inspector about the Katzenjammer kids, but he could have been speaking of all comic strips in their formative years at the turn of the last century. From the very first color Sunday supplement, comics were a driving force in newspaper sales, even though their crude and often offensive content placed them in a whirl of controversy. Sunday comics presented a wild parody of the world and the culture that surrounded them. Society didn't stand a chance. These are the origins of the American comic strip, born at a time when there were no set styles or formats, when artistic anarchy helped spawn a new medium. Here are the earliest offerings from known greats like R. F. Outcault, George McManus, Winsor McCay, and George Herriman, along with the creations of more than fifty other superb cartoonists; over 150 Sunday comics dating from 1895 to 1915."

Featuring the works of twenty one of the best-known South and North Korean artists, the exhibition provides a running commentary that reflects the lives of ordinary people, at once joyful, satirical and penetrating. What shines most prominently through these works is an engaged and vigorous civil society in Korea, continuously challenging and energizing the status quo in whimsical and provocative ways. By so doing, they play an important role in characterizing and distiguishing the culture, sensibility and sentiment of two Koreas.\""
