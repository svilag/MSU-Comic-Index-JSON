Determined to be human, she strikes a bargain with the devious seawitch, Ursula, and trades her fins and beautiful voice for legs. With her best friend Flounder, and her reluctant chaperone Sebastian at her side, Ariel must win the prince's love and save her father's kingdom."

On stage the band gels, but off-stage things aren't going quite so smoothly. Sebastien has developed an attraction to Alicia that is not in the band's best interest. And the band's enigmatic new lead singer's dabbling in the occult threatens more than their carefully laid plans for success. A story of sex, drugs, &amp; rock 'n' roll, and a little bit of magic.\""

But as Carol returns home after the encounter, she finds herself a changed woman. Something is weakening her powers and threatens to ground the high-flying hero for good. A new version of an old foe enters the fray, and Captain America gives Carol new wings in the form of old wheels as the incredible adventures of Earth's mightiest hero continue!"
