He always chose to do the right thing, fighting for truth, justice, and the American way, and represents America at its best. The in-depth analyses of the comics, films and cartoons are at turns funny, philosophical, insightful, and personal, exploring every aspect of the Superman legend.\""

      "Summary (from SkyRiver): Don't let where you came from dictate who you are, but let it be part of who you become. These are the words of successful entrepreneur Robert Renteria who grew up as an infant sleeping in a dresser drawer. This hard-hitting comic memoir traces Robert's life from a childhood of poverty and abuse in one of the poorest areas of East Los Angeles, to his proud emergence as a business owner and civic leader today. Robert paints a vivid portrait of the numerous people who influenced his life and the forces that dragged him down",
      "gangs, drugs, an alcohol and drug addicted father that abandoned the family, an abusive stepfather and climbing the broken ladder of corporate America. The book drives home the point that there's nothing that any American",
      "Latino or otherwise",
      "can't accomplish through persistence, hard work, heart and soul."
