Rather than return to the princess's father with the new dragon, The Mercenary and the two dragons die temporarily and go to Hell. The Mercenary takes a black globe on the verge of exploding with him, and convinces Satan to make Endore reverse her spell. She does, and the three are revived successfully.

      "Summary: The Redcoat soldiers arrest a man in the street who complains loudly of his fate, but when he is taken to the commanding officer it turns out he's an undercover agent, a traitor turning over a list of patriots' names. Lord Marmaduke Langsburry, an emisary direct from the King in London, witnesses the transaction and asks to see the list. Lord Langsburry pockets the list, then removes his beard to reveal that he is indeed Captain Swing. In short order the traitor is dead, and the fine carriage that brought \"Langsburry\" has left at a gallop. The British soldiers take off after the carriage, making it easy for Swing to sneak out of the headquarters to hide with his old friend Professor Griffith. The professor is puzzling over an old Rosicrucian book he bought from an antiquarian book dealer in Strasbourg. The reading isn't going well since it's Greco-Latino-Hebraic in runic characters. By chance, a soldier has seen Swing enter Griffith's house, so the soldiers come and the two have to flee. Also there is a sinister-looking bald man lurking in the house looking for a chance to steal the book. The professor takes the book with him, and they ride to Fort Ontario. Betty sets the professor up with a place to study. The creepy bald man returns to his home as well, on Black Skull Mountain, which is not far from Fort Ontario. He thinks awhile, then sends one of his superstitious Black servants, named Mumbulah, to go to Fort Ontario on Lake Ontario and retrieve the book, no matter whose life it costs. Meanwhile Griffith suddenly figures out the book, and it makes him crazy. He babbles nonsense and ancient-sounding words, and tries to kill Mister Bluff's dog, Pouik, by hanging it by the neck with a rope. Griffith's raving is so violent they have to tie him up. Mumbulah arrives at the fort and tries to steal the book, but gets locked up for his trouble. Hibou thinks sorcery is involved. Taking the book, Swing rides out from Lake Ontario for a few hours to a mountain cave full of books, bottles and a smoking brazier. Swing asks the wise man there to take a look at the book, and the wise man is interested. He says to come back in a few days when he's studied the book. Meanwhile, the strange bald man from Black Skull Mountain shows up at Fort Ontario asking for lodging. As he enters both Griffith and Mumbulah can be heard raving from their respective lockups, and Mister Bluff wonders if it might be the weather causing it. Hibou says that Indians lose their spirit in captivity too, and in sympathy lets Mumbulah out for some exercise. Mumbulah sees his master and immediately commits suicide by jumping from a tower. Then the bald man hypnotizes Betty from behind without her having even seen him. He tells her to go to town and buy a blue dress, and when she leaves the fort on foot he kidnaps her. When Swing comes back from delivering the book to his guru, a ransom note is found. The Rosicrucian book must be brought to Black Skull Mountain in exchange for Betty's life. Swing, Bluff and Hibou retrace Swing's path to retrieve the book, and arrive just as the wise man has deciphered it. He also starts raving and has to be tied up. The bald man gets excited when he mentally feels the book approaching, the book that was \"stolen from them at Tubingen.\" The man tries to capture Swing rather than release Betty, and in the struggle the book and the whole house are burned to ashes. At that moment both of the raving scholars are released from their spells miles apart. They get together at Fort Ontario and agree that the destruction of the book was a good thing. The one from the mountain, the one that Swing calls \"master,\" quotes Shakespeare: \"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosopy.\""

Though Dante believes that the Kraken is only an immortal and troublesome beast, the Church suspects that it is actually Satan himself. In the bunker are a radar station, to watch for the Kraken, and a pulpit, so the exorcist can preach to it. Dante, with some of his men, and the priest's obnoxious assistant are also locked in for the duration. After nine hours of impassioned preaching the Kraken arrives, and the priest seems to die. After hitting the bunker a few times the Kraken leaves. The priest then comes alive again, and is shot by his assistant who thinks the priest is now possessed. The priest, dying once more, says that the assistant is the one who is possessed."

Edmond Hillinghead is an 1890s overachiever who's trying to solve a murder no one cares about while hiding his own secret. Karl Whiteman is our dashing 1940s adventurer with a shocking past. Shahara Hasan is 2014's kickass female Detective Sergeant, who walks the line between religion and power. And Maplewood, an amnesiac from post-apocalyptic 2050, brings a haunting perspective to it all. Si Spencer executes a centuries-spanning murder mystery like nothing you've ever seen before, with four sensational artists illustrating a six-page chapter in each issue.\"",

      "Summary (from OCLC): The Vinyl Underground is led by Morrison Shepherd, a D-list celebrity darling, soul DJ, and son of an ex-footballer. Fresh out of prison and off a nasty coke habit, Morrison is joined by a fellow ex-con named Perv, whose seizures give him clues to crimes long before the cops, and Leah, a gorgeous morgue assistant who leads a double life online and represents the brawn of the team. Morrison's ex-flame Abi is reluctantly forced to join the team when her father is implicated for murder. A young boy's head (with diamonds in the eye sockets) washes up on the edge of the Thames and seems to be connected to a series of ritual killings, a drug called Khat, and Muti magic. Can they get to the bottom of it?"

On returning to Daisy Town, Luke finds out that the outlaw's mother Ma Dalton has been robbing all the shopkeepers in the area.

When Joe Dalton hears that his Ma has a new \"son\" he is furious and breaks out of prison with his brothers. Joe is chained to Bushwack, the \"dumbest guard dog in the West\" so every time Bushwack chases something Joe goes for a painful ride. Luke is caught between the Dalton boys and their Ma with the lovely Lotta wanting some of his attentions as well."

Now, aided by the mysterious Agent 355, the last human male Yorick Brown must contend with dangerous extremists, a hoped-for reunion with a girlfriend on the other side of the globe, and the search for exactly why he's the only man to survive."

Adam has figured out how to make any sphere self-destruct by sticking a pin in a certain point on it, and has further determined that his hut is on the Earth's destruct point. Whenever he tries his procedure, spheres for miles around break in sympathy, and the villagers are sick of losing lamps. The villagers go to the hut intent on destroying it, and Adam worries what might happen. Just then a gigantic pin from outer space pokes a hole through the hut into the ground, but nothing else happens."

Pharas takes the assembled company into a spherical ship, apparently manned by people from the undersea civilization, and they journey to where Rork can be seen in suspended animation, caught between worlds. Deliah tries to free him with her powers, which Pharas thinks will ruin everything, when suddenly Adam Niels hits the spherical ship with an arrow to its fatal point, and blows it up. Adam has figured out that it was this ship that earlier destroyed his laboratory. Adam reveals that it was he who hired Raffington Stevens. In the confusion, Rork and Deliah have teleported together, but Pharas says they probably didn't arrive anywhere together."

A mysterious <a href=\"/rri/krri/knack.htm#knights\">knight</a> in armor interrupts\n        the discovery, and adopts Anicet for a page. Mariotte follows\n        them since she can't go home. The knight's face is disfigured\n        and he gives no name. He has a <a href=\"/rri/qrri/quest.htm#ests\">quest,</a> but he doesn't know what\n        it is. Night catches the three of them in a forest, and they\n        are captured by <a href=\"/rri/grri/go.htm#goblins\">goblins,</a> who plan to eat them. The goblins decide to give them a chance,\n        and say that if before dawn the knight can kill a monster\n        that's been eating goblins, the humans will be free to go. All\n        the while, the three humans are unsure if the goblins are a\n        shared dream or not. The knight manages to kill the nemesis, a\n        bear, and at dawn the three are released. <p>This summary is from <em>European Comics in English\n        Translation</em> (Jefferson, NC : McFarland &amp; Company, 2002).\n        Used with permission.<br/></p>"
