Flying over the sea he appreciates the beauty, then finds ocean creatures dying from a toxic spill from a World War II freighter. He picks up the ship thinking that though he vowed not to interfere in conflicts between nations he can't leave this alone (note the conflict has been over for 40 years!). 'With everything else that needs to be done in the world, why should I have to protect Earth from its own inhabitants?' He is conflicted about not having enough time either as Superman or as Clark Kent. He'd like to do small acts of kindness like blowing down acorns for hungry squirrels. He thinks Lana should have more time with him as Clark. Getting back in time to anchor the news, an admiring technician gives him perspective, and he feels better about his lives."
