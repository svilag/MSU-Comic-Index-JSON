Rocky Langford, age 16, is sent to bed without supper in a nearby orphanage, and decides to run away. Rocky soon rescues Lassie from some trigger-happy country folk, and they run away together. Rocky needs a job, but on his first try a sawmill boss knocks him out and steals Lassie. They recover and escape again, and hitch a ride with a friendly family that's relocating. The family helps Rocky get a job on a riverboat heading for New Orleans. In New Orleans, Rocky rescues a boy and gets a job at a boatyard with the boy's grateful guardian. Rocky learns the trade, gets his own sloop by fixing it up, and sails away with Lassie to see the world. A storm comes up, Lassie is washed overboard, and Rocky makes it to Jamaica with his boat half wrecked. Meanwhile Lassie has been rescued by Mr. Lawrence, a plantation owner, and his yacht, and his daughter Gerry. The yacht has come to Jamaica too, and Lassie finds Rocky. Mr. Lawrence offers Rocky a job as timekeeper on his coffee plantation, partly because he wants Gerry to have someone her own age nearby."
