      "Summary: Rork arrives at a little cliffside village in the Mexican desert, which has been preparing for a year for an astronomical event predicted by an ancient painting on the side of the cliff. The effort is being coordinated by Deliah Darkthorne, or Low Valley as she now prefers to be called. Low has aged 40 years in the year and a half since teleporting at the end of the Passages album. She is the one who sent the note summoning Rork. Low doesn't understand what the \"event\" is going to be, only that a beam of light will come down from the sky and that it will have transformational powers. Low has placed experiments in the path of the beam, like a mouse, a cactus, and an apple. The beam comes, and things change, but the results aren't very comprehensible. Low takes Rork to another room and shows him her daughter, Sy-Ra, who is floating in the air stuck between worlds as Rork was near the end of \"Passages.\" Low wants Rork to take Sy-Ra to an astrologer to get her fixed up, and Rork agrees. Then Low eats the apple from the beam experiment, and seems to gain a new sense of well-being and extended perceptions. She tells Rork they'll meet again in nine months, at his house."
