One of those heroes is a very young ace pilot, Steve Traynor, also known as Jetlad, fresh from the battle-torn skies of Europe, and anxious for a new life and career. With him is his former enemy combatant Leni Muller, the Sky Witch, ready to prove herself worthy of the chance given to her in Neopolis. They are hardly prepared for the challenges facing the experimental city. Science crime and unearthly gang violence has swiftly followed the heroes into this new, wide-open environment. Will their courage and skills be enough for the tasks ahead?"

Now, tired of her unending spree of plunder and destruction, Janni launches a grand expedition to surpass her father's greatest failure: the exploration of Antarctica. Hot on her frozen trail are a trio of genius inventors, hired by an influential publishing tycoon to retrieve the plundered valuables of an African queen. It's a deadly race to the bottom of the world, an uncharted land of wonder and horror where time is broken and the mountains bring madness. Jules Verne meets H.P. Lovecraft in the unforgettable final showdown, lost in the living, beating and appallingly inhuman Heart of Ice.\""

Captain Marvel checks it out, and indeed the apes are occupying human villages and using human weapons. Captain Marvel assumes a human trainer is behind this behavior. The apes can't talk. Monkeys and chimpanzees are also acting this way. Captain Marvel next finds a band of white men with firebrands chasing black people, and the men tell him how to find their boss, whom they've never seen. The \"ape mastermind\" catches and gags Billy Batson, and explains himself. He was born extra intelligent, and knows both human speech and ape language. He plans to conquer Africa, then the world, because \"humans have ruled Earth too long!\" The ape is about to throw Billy into a fire, when the human henchmen arrive, curious to see what their boss is like. One of them says, \"We aren't low enough to turn traitor to the human race by helping apes! It was all a mistake!\" The ape is put in a cage to be studied by scientists for the rest of his \"natural life.\"",

As Bugs is telling Porky Pig about it the next day, a policeman tells them that Bugs' mysterious man is Professor Bimbloke, a scientist who claims to have discovered the Fountain of Youth, and he is missing. Bugs and Porky accidentally drop the bottle and a rooster drinks it, and promptly turns into a chick. The chick waddles off to Elmer Fudd's home with Bugs and Porky following, and they realize that the Fountain is in Elmer's back yard. Meanwhile the villains have gotten the location of the fountain out of the professor. One comes back to steal the water, but Bugs throws some on him and turns him into an innocent juvenile, who happily leads them to the professor. After the villains are arrested, Bugs, and Elmer and the professor return to bottle the water, but the fountain has gone dry. Petunia had a bottle of the water, but before she drank from the bottle she refilled it with fresh water."

Steve has found the stub of a foreign cigarette that he thinks is connected to the disappearance. He finds the smoker and follows him to an apartment full of \"foreign-looking men.\" The police, whom Wiley has called, soon arrive. The foreigners are indeed spies, and Dr. Courtney is found on the premises. He had been working on a \"device to counter guided missiles,\" which is what the spies wanted. The duplicate newspaper stories were the result of Wiley's hired man fishing carbon paper out of his wastebasket, and the hired man is no longer hired."

And revered scientist Dr. Woodrow Wilson Moreland has just the ticket for Alex and his girlfriend, Robin Castagna: an all-expenses-paid vacation to a Pacific island retreat. It won't all be fun in the sun, however. But helping Dr. Moreland prepare his fascinating case files for publication is business Alex is happy to mix with pleasure. Unfortunately, pleasure is in short supply on the remote island of Aruk, with its dark history hanging heavy in the tropical air. Though reports of a bloody native uprising and mutants haunting the jungle may be rumors, the brutal, unsolved murder of a young woman is very real. So is the bad vibe Alex and Robin get from a battling pair of married scientists, a scandal-hunting writer, a duo of menacing beach bums, and a politician with a hidden agenda. Not to mention their enigmatic host, a man being eaten alive by secrets. As another savage murder stuns the island, a dangerous storm closes in, and so does the conspiracy consuming Aruk like a strangling vine. With no one to trust but each other, Alex and Robin must track down the hellish truth beneath a lost paradise",
