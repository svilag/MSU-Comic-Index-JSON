In contrast, Harry had always wilted under life's pressures and the strain of his father's domineering influence, unable to live up to Norman's expectations. Unfortunately, Harry remained unaware of his father's dark side as the Green Goblin until it was too late. Witnessing Norman's apparent death in battle with Spider-Man, Harry was driven to the brink of insanity. Assuming his late father's identity, he began a descent into madness that would haunt him his entire life, for only in death could he finally find peace.
