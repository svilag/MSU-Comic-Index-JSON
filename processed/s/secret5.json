The Chef has stolen an ambulance and Moreau has sprained an ankle, so Barelli, Inspector Lapiste, and the ambulance driver give chase. The third ambulance they catch is the right one, but it's empty. They find Randor in a doctor's office near the abandoned vehicle, but not the Chef. Randor is soon kidnapped again from the doctor's office. This doctor is a plastic surgeon, and he is working for the Chef. A secret passage from the doctor's bathroom leads to a chase through tunnels. The Chef gets away, but Randor is recovered and Barelli ends up in a basement cabaret."

      "Summary: Fort Brix is under siege, and food and ammunition are almost gone. Captain Swing sneaks in through a passageway only he knows, to try to encourage the defenders. Only two more days and reenforcements will arrive. Colonel Hopkins is in despair, though. If the British actually push their advantage the fort won't last two hours. Hopkins wonders how Swing got past the British lines and Swing explains, but somebody overhears. That night a silver platter is thrown out the window of Fort Brix with the details of the secret passage scratched on it. The British sneak in. Only Captain Swing, the Colonel's daughter Vivian, and her fiancé Bertie Wilkins survive. Swing is badly wounded. He tells a general investigating the case that he only told Colonel Hopkins about the passage, and although the Colonel is dead he is disgraced as a traitor. Capt. Swing takes several weeks to recover from his wounds. Then, at an inn, Swing accidentally finds the silver platter because of a confusion of luggage with another guest. The confusion is soon corrected and Swing doesn't know the significance of the platter, but Vivian and Bertie chance to come in as he is holding it. Bertie recognizes it, and since he signed the message with his initials decides that Swing must already know about his treachery. Bertie's efforts to recover the platter are to no avail, of course, because the other customer has it and has gone on his way. Swing is knocked out by a mysterious man searching his room (it was Bertie) and is invited to Vivian's place to recover. Vivian seems to have a slave named Sam, or at least a very obsequious Black servant and cook. Bertie hires a man to kill Swing, and has Mister Bluff (Swing's sidekick) taken hostage. The ransom note demands the silver plate, but Swing doesn't know what that's about. Swing is being held at gunpoint by the kidnappers when Pouik (Bluff's dog) brings him a pistol and joins the fray. Hibou (another sidekick) turns up as well, and Bluff is soon freed. The man with the platter knows its significance, and returns to ask Vivian for 200 guineas to prove her father's innocence. Bertie Wilkins gets to the man first, stabs him, and takes the platter. The man lives long enough to explain it to Vivian and Swing. Swing finds Wilkins trying to bury the platter, and the game is up. The Hopkins name is cleared, and Vivian is single again."

After the squadron has left to take advantage of the plans, the woman steals a gun and kills the radio operator. The crew of Madam X figures out what has happened, and leaves sick bay in a suicide mission to spring the ambush the Japanese have set up. On page 7, a Japanese radioman says, \"Silver disks",

Steve has found the stub of a foreign cigarette that he thinks is connected to the disappearance. He finds the smoker and follows him to an apartment full of \"foreign-looking men.\" The police, whom Wiley has called, soon arrive. The foreigners are indeed spies, and Dr. Courtney is found on the premises. He had been working on a \"device to counter guided missiles,\" which is what the spies wanted. The duplicate newspaper stories were the result of Wiley's hired man fishing carbon paper out of his wastebasket, and the hired man is no longer hired."

      "Summary (form OCLC): The late Will Eisner, the great American master of comics, regarded this, his last work, as his most powerful. This nonfiction book in graphic-novel style examines the outrageous fabrication of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which purports to be the blueprint by Jewish leaders to take over the world. Hatched as an anti-Semitic plot by the tsar's secret police to deflect widespread criticism of the Russian government, the forgery, first published in 1905, succeeded beyond the propagandistic ambitions of its originators; the lie became an internationally accepted truth. Presenting a pageant of historical figures including Tsar Nicholas II, Henry Ford, and Adolf Hitler, Eisner exposes the twisted history of the Protocols from nineteenth-century Russia to modern-day Klan members to Islamic fundamentalists. The Plot unravels one of the most devastating hoaxes of the twentieth century."
