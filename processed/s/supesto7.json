      "Summary (by Mary Walker): Luthor is back and a pair of his employees take over the WGBS station to issue a challenge for Superman to meet him at high noon the next day. The first engagement has Superman ending up imprisoned in Luthor's war suit which is programmed to discharge red solar energy whenever its prisoner tries to break free. He tries to contact Jimmy but Jimmy refuses to believe that Superman is imprisoned and the suit reinforces that with a manufactured image of Luthor. It tries to kill Jimmy and then threatens to kill anyone else Superman tries to contact. However Superman has left a message burned in Kryptonese on the wall, which Jimmy deciphers. Next day another strange creature (Trogar) comes to challenge Superman and Superman has to face him looking like and sounding like Luthor. He makes it sound like Luthor is giving Superman a testimonial. This is to much for Luthor's vanity, and soon the battle suit disappears releasing Superman. Trogar turns out to have been Supergirl in disguise. Luthor isn't exactly unhappy because the battle suit has given him a wealth of information about his enemy's physiology which he hopes to use in the next meeting."

      "Summary (by Mary Walker): Superman is the main attraction at a Lung Foundation fundraiser challenging anyone from the crowd for donations. The first taker is a construction worker who challenges him to an arm wrestling match. Superman agrees and to make things more even allows the man to wrestle using a back-hoe. Perry notes that even so it is one sided, but Superman says that at least one person in the crowd \"can do something that is impossible for me to do!\" and that whoever guesses what it is gets a tour of his fortress. The first guess is that he has no ear for music, so he performs a Beethoven selection as a one man orchestra. The next is juggling which he does while saving two vehicles from colliding. Perry finally wins by offering Superman a cigar but he can't if he wanted because his respiratory system won't allow tobacco to enter his lungs. Every earlier attempt was rejected with \"No cigar\" which tipped White off. The episode has further benefits as Perry decides to cut back on the cigars."

Moe has a habit of having prophetic dreams, or affective dreams. His brother, a hood who sees a way to profit from this one, gathers together the heads of the Metropolis mobs and introduces Moe as the man who can beat Superman. At the same time Superman finds that his super-strength ebbs and flows, sometimes present but at other times embarassingly absent. Finally he has a compulsion to go to the arena where Moe is waiting for the fight, which ends as he dreamed it. Superman recovers for the rematch, finds that both his strength and invulnerability have returned and Moe is beaten. He tells Superman about the dreams."

Superman then goes to the main areas of the ship to stop the war. The combatants stop long enough to explain that they have \"divided into nations according to our various races and religions. Differences inevitably lead to conflict!\" and then resume their fighting. He wishes they could be persuaded to work together as they did in building the ship in the first place",

He picks up the ship thinking that though he vowed not to interfere in conflicts between nations he can't leave this alone (note the conflict has been over for 40 years!). 'With everything else that needs to be done in the world, why should I have to protect Earth from its own inhabitants?' He is conflicted about not having enough time either as Superman or as Clark Kent. He'd like to do small acts of kindness like blowing down acorns for hungry squirrels. He thinks Lana should have more time with him as Clark. Getting back in time to anchor the news, an admiring technician gives him perspective, and he feels better about his lives."

He is hoping to find something at the site of a UFO landing, but loses his footing and is injured. An alien heals him and explains that his ship is normally invisible. Nyxly repays the alien by knocking him out and taking his ship. The first encounter goes badly for Superman, who leaves and shows up catatonic in the WGBS Building. The alien arrives and begins treatment for a brain short circuit. Nyxly raises havok and Jimmy gets an idea from the alien's comment that Superman would be in a suggestible state until he has healed. They give Superman a remote earpiece and Jimmy directs Superman's assault, followed by Lois, then by Edge. After the battle the alien diagnoses the problem as Kryptonian Sleeping Sickness, against which he was never vaccinated because he left Krypton before it was scheduled."

The news media name him \"Superman-X.\" Guns turn to dust, kryptonite turns to sandstone, and people begin to think the replacement has surpassed Superman. Superman-X cures hopeless diseases, etc., but doesn't balance his deeds with self-restraint. Lois and Jimmy show Superman-X a news story in which a child with polio and leg braces is killed in the chaos of people trying to get to the \"savior\" at the hospital gates. Superman-X believes it and leaves in a wail of anguish, but the tape was a fake, nobody has died, although the chaos was real. The real Superman returns soon after (summary by Mary Walker)."
