Morrison's ex-flame Abi is reluctantly forced to join the team when her father is implicated for murder. A young boy's head (with diamonds in the eye sockets) washes up on the edge of the Thames and seems to be connected to a series of ritual killings, a drug called Khat, and Muti magic.

Black Bolt and Maximus have been secretly involved with the New Avengers' activities for months now, but that's not even close to the whole story of their absence. The Boltagon brothers are in trouble - and it's going to end very badly for one of them! Meanwhile, Medusa's inversion thanks to the events of Axis is making her a very different ruler of Attilan. What is the Ennilux Corporation, and how does it factor into the Inhumans' future? Reader and Iso make their return, but they're in horrible danger! Who will rise to fill the throne of Attilan?"

As the mysterious Lash takes an unwanted interest in the new Inhumans and the newly transformed Flint sees his world fall apart, Queen Medusa finds herself fighting side-by-side with Captain America. When the deposed Inhuman king returns, determined to regain his throne, he quickly takes the royal family captive and conquers Medusa's new island nation.

Brought in by Behemoth himself, the vampire Bohemond Jaggar de Rochambeau IIII is officially supposed to help CEO Francis in managing the park. But the employees expect the worst: isn't he known as a cold-blooded killer? If one looks more closely, the reasons for his coming may seem less anodyne than announced. Of course, his mission is to increase return on investment for the shareholders, but for Behemoth that return has to be in souls. Francis is appalled but obligated to kowtow to the almighty consultant, determined to take power and pervert the rules of Zombillenium. Meanwhile, Aurelian goes through a bad patch. Depressed by his immortal status and the absurdity of his life (sorry, his death) he's burned out. And burnout, in a powerful demon, can be devastating. Held back in extremis by Gretchen, he avoids the worst. This is timely, because Gretchen has a plan for him. A particularly biting new episode of Zombillenium in which we discover the underbelly of the most monstrous amusement park in the world."

The Lord is hard to track, though, even for someone whose soul has been merged with a near-omnipotent supernatural entity called Genesis. To pick up the trail, Jesse needs to get inside his own head for a one-on-one talk with his guest - and for that, a fistful of peyote taken under the open Arizona sky seems just the ticket. What's waiting for him in Monument Valley, however, is something much less spiritual: an entire U.S. Army tank regiment, commandeered by the newly elevated Allfather of the Grail, Herr Starr. Determined to harness the power of Genesis for himself, Starr is willing to use everything in the American military arsenal to force Jesse to his will - and neither side is going to walk away from this showdown without taking heavy casualties."

There he meets Helga, the eldest daughter: bright, good-natured, and just beginning to suspect the horror that surrounds her. This is the story of an unlikely friendship and of a childhood betrayed, a grim parable of naïvete and evil, and a vivid, unsettling masterpiece of comics storytelling. As Germany descends into chaos, Helga's and Hermann's lives intertwine, then finally collide. In Hitler's Berlin bunker, with the Red Army closing in, Hermann receives his greatest assignment: recording the Fuhrer's final words",

      "Summary: Giddap Joe rides into Axonville, and the town appears deserted. The men of the town are waiting in ambush, however, and Giddap soon has a noose around his neck and is headed for a lynching. Then a little girl, Julie Copping, cries out that Joe is her friend, and the townspeople relent. They had thought that Joe was part of a gang chasing Jim and Rose Copping, Julie's parents. Julie gives Joe the map to her father's gold strike. Joe decides he'd better go help his old friend Jim, so he thanks the townspeople for the loan of the necktie, takes it off, and prepares to leave. Before he can start, Lou Marks knocks him down and steals the map. In flashback, we learn that after Copping found the gold, the crooked sheriff of the town of Garriot has tried to steal his claim. Copping had shot \"sheriff\" Kaye in the arm, and Copping had spent three years in jail for it. Upon his release, Kaye was waiting with to cronies to continue the pursuit of Copping's gold. In the present, Loe Marks volunteers to join Giddap Joe as he rides out to find the Coppings. Marks is sure that Joe didn't see him when he stole the map. In the mountains, Rose Copping's horse is frightened by a rattlesnake, and she falls to the ground and is threatened by the snake. She wants Jim to shoot the snake, but he is sure that the sound of the shot would bring Kaye and his men straight to them. He lassos the snake neatly around its \"neck\" and throws it aside. Rose's horse's leg is broken, and Jim won't shoot it for the same reason, but Rose shoots it out of compassion. Sure enough, the couple is captured in a trice and threats to Rose soon elicit another map from Jim. At the entry to the cave where the gold is, Kaye stops and sends one of his men in to check the truth of Copping's story. The man doesn't come out, so Kaye sends another man in. Giddap Joe and Lou Marks (Lou having had a change of heart) were waiting inside the cave and have overpowered the two men. Joe then steps out of the cave and arrests Kaye."
