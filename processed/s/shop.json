After graduation, she moved to a big city and took a job at an advertising agency, just to pay off her student loans, but now she's worked in the same office for five years and the only thing she's written is copy. She longs for companionship (other than her cat), receives no satisfaction from her job, and feels numbed by the monotony of a life experienced through a series of screens. But whenever she shoplifts a magazine from the corner store near her apartment, she feels a little, what? A little more alive. Yet Corinna knows there must be something more to life, as she faces the question everyone of her generation is facing right now: how to find it?\""

Finally after a stint in the army Frank got to prove how good he'd become with a gun, and so began a reign of terror the like of which has not been seen since in Chicago. Nobody messed with the Enforcer. Not even he could escape the long arm of the law forever, but who knew Hollywood would prove his undoing?"
