      "Summary: Rockfort, the Rock Detective, is hired by Baron von Funkenstein to find a dangerous missing \"person.\" This person is a scientific creation made of body parts from Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Elvis Presley. John Lennon's ears had yet to be attached, but more importantly the monster does not yet have a soul. The soul of Otis Redding was to be the next addition. The monster's name is Prance. Rockfort gets a message to Prance that he has John Lennon's ears, and Prance comes to Rockfort's office to get them, locking Rockfort in an oven as he leaves. Rockfort blows the oven open with the speakers in his shoulder pads, and causes Prance to short-circuit on stage by making him listen to his own music with John Lennon's ears."

      "Summary (from publisher via OCLC): \"Charles M. Schulz (1922-2000) believed that the key to cartooning was to take out the extraneous details and leave in \"only what's necessary.\" For fifty years, from October 2, 1950, to February 13, 2000, Schulz wrote and illustrated Peanuts, the single most popular and influential comic strip in the world. In all, 17,897 strips were published, making it \"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being,\" according to Robert Thompson, professor of popular culture at Syracuse University. For Only What's Necessary: Charles M. Schulz and the Art of Peanuts, renowned designer Chip Kidd was granted unprecedented access to the extraordinary archives of the Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center in Santa Rosa, California. Reproducing the best of the Peanuts newspaper strip, all shot from the original art by award-winning photographer Geoff Spear, Only What's Necessary also features exclusive, rare, and unpublished original art and developmental work, much of which has never been seen before.\""

      "Summary (from OCLC): When Macon is beaten up by his boss, his comic-obsessed friends intervene and together they form the Comic Book Liberation Army, which prompts the town to take action against the fledgling club. Max is a grave-robbing 13-year-old who gathers relics to pawn for comic book money. Macon works at the local Mallmart by day and publishes his comic book manifestos by night. Madison is a punk beauty who just might be able to fly. When Macon gets badly beaten in a fight with his boss over comic books, Macon and Madison take revenge by smashing the front of the store. They leave their calling card graffitied across the wreckage: Comic Book Liberation Army. The next day Max joins in the mayhem and soon the town has declared all-out war on comic books. Thus begins Teenagers From Mars, a chaotic comics extravaganza in which three teens strive against censorship, and adults, to protect the comics they love. Originally published as a series of comics, Teenagers from Mars shows what happens when people who love comics enough to fight for them are forced to."

The men are chasing a dragon, a big green dinosaur that attacks as the situation is being explained. The stranger grabs a spear and kills the dragon himself because a wizard has told him if he does so, then burns the dragon's heart with some of his lady love's hair, it'll save her life. Her name is Princess Anne, and she's sick. The Night Faces warn the stranger that there will be side effects, but he's in love and won't listen. The heart is burned, the princess wakes up back in the castle, and the stranger turns into a little no-face man."

      "Summary (by Ben Chabala): Tarzan and Chief Buto are out hunting lions when they meet a fierce warrior and wrestler named Adumo, he of the Nuba tribe from the mountain lands of Barango. Initially the newcomer is afraid of Tarzan and Buto, fearing the long spears. Why? To Tarzan and Buto's shock and dismay, all of the Nuba, Adamo's people, are slaves to the Kordo, a violent and cruel spear-wielding tribe. Tarzan and Buto know what they must do, and the three men travel to Adumo's village to put an end to the Kordos' cruelty."
