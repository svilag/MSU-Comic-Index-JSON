      "Summary (from gumroad.com): \"Moonsprout Station is a hopeful, queer, fantasy series about relationships and identity. In the Summer of 2018, I went to Japan for a job with my swashbuckling captain La Carmina, and afterwards we got to travel for a bit around Japan and Thailand with my partner Becky (also a cartoonist) and our friend Yukiro (the inimitable drag queen). I got to do lots of drawings on the trip but didn't know how to put them in my comic, so I started mailing letters and drawings about our travels to my own fantasy characters. It got kind of out of hand, and now it can be in your hands! Foggy Mountain Letters has 23 pages of traditional art (inkwash and watercolor) and contains an exclusive 11 page Moonsprout Station story, travel drawings and paintings from all over Japan and Bangkok, and a short travel guide if you want to visit any of the real locations featured in the book.\""

Surely the luck lay with passers-by who, statistically, were far less likely to be similarly soiled, at that precise moment. Similarly, the Playwright always derived an almost perverse sense of relief whenever he received news that an old friend had developed prostate cancer. Because statistically, he reasoned, such news significantly reduced the chances of him being similarly afflicted.
