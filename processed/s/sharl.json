The infinitely perfect God is independent and the world of matter and spirits is dependent on God. he advocated total surrender to God to achieve salvation.\""

He can self-heal any wound, any disease, never has to brush his teeth, diet, worry about aging, or use a toilet. The nanomachines in his body process everything and keep him in peak physical condition. This condition brought on by artificial means is what makes him a xombi. 2) He has now become a magnet for supernatural phenomenon.

Initially he is content with bilking her of $1,000, but a criminal crony gives him the idea of marrying her and going for some big life insurance money. He plans to kill his newlywed wife on their honeymoon using carbon monoxide poisoning. He pays for his dishonesty with his life, because the carbon monoxide kills the weakling before it can kill his bride. A policeman coldly tells her that \"fat people take a lot longer to die of this kind of gas than thin people,\" and so many lessons are learned."
