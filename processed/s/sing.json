Now in his early 70s as he looks back on his career, Chan has spent a lifetime making comics in his native Singapore since he was a boy of 16, in 1954. The artist doubles here as both the narrator and the subject matter, as his life story parallels the changes in Singapore over five decades since the war. The evolution of his artwork mirrors the evolution of both his homeland and the comic book medium itself. The myriad art styles employed by Liew go beyond deft sleight-of-hand and actually inform the narrative in a thoroughly ingenious and engaging way. While all the detail about the formation of the Singapore government adheres meticulously to the facts, the reader is ultimately left wondering whether or not Charlie Chan Hock Chye himself is real or a construct. And given the subject at hand, that quandary only adds to the themes raised in this enthralling graphic novel.\""

      "Summary (from publisher via OCLC): \"Meet Charlie Chan Hock Chye. Now in his early 70s as he looks back on his career, Chan has spent a lifetime making comics in his native Singapore since he was a boy of 16, in 1954. The artist doubles here as both the narrator and the subject matter, as his life story parallels the changes in Singapore over five decades since the war. The evolution of his artwork mirrors the evolution of both his homeland and the comic book medium itself. The myriad art styles employed by Liew go beyond deft sleight-of-hand and actually inform the narrative in a thoroughly ingenious and engaging way. While all the detail about the formation of the Singapore government adheres meticulously to the facts, the reader is ultimately left wondering whether or not Charlie Chan Hock Chye himself is real or a construct. And given the subject at hand, that quandary only adds to the themes raised in this enthralling graphic novel.\""

Meanwhile, Mohand, a young man of Algerian origin who calls himself Vincent, is a singer with a band called \"The Gold Star.\" The band is competing in a music competition which happens to be held on the same night of the planned demonstration. The demonstration is brutally repressed and in the following days, Mohand goes in search of his younger sister, who disappeared that night. Oct. 17, 1961 is now known as Black October.

      "Summary: A group of Redcoats commanded by a Lieutenant Abbott stops at an inn where Bluff and Hibou are waiting to meet Cap'tain Swing. The innkeeper, Simeon, has had a run-in with the bad-tempered Abbott before, so he runs off when Bluff offers to play host. Abbott has a mysterious small chest with him that he seems to be guarding with exaggerated care. Hibou and Bluff are curious, so Hibou ties some pans to Pouik's tail to distract Abbott, and Bluff switches the contents of the chest for some stinky cheese. Meanwhile, a few miles away, Swing is talking to Madame Meyer, a lady from whom the British have just stolen a small chest of family jewels. Also her husband has been missing for three days. When Swing arrives at the inn the English soldiers have gone. He and Bluff look at the jewels and Swing sends Bluff and Hibou to return them to Madame Meyer and to look for her husband, while Swing continues on his previous mission for Dr. Strong. Another guest at the inn overhears and steals the jewels. Meanwhile the Governor has presented the box of stinky cheese to his wife as a gift, and Lt. Abbott is in deep trouble. Three days later Swing hears a troubador singing a ballad of Spartacus, and Swing asks the singer where he can find Spartacus. The singer says he might not even exist, but another audience member says to ask the Redcoats, who have been humiliated by Spartacus a thousand times. Swing meets Spartacus in a bar, goes to his hideout, and asks him for Dr. Strong to join an American attack on the British. Hibou and Bluff, thanks to Pouik's tracking ability, arrive at the hideout at the same time on the trail of the jewel thief. It turns out to be the wife of Spartacus who stole the jewels in order to buy arms for the resistance. It turns out also that Spartacus is just a bandit and he is also holding Mr. Meyer captive. Swing frees Meyer, returns the jewels, and kidnaps Spartacus for trial in an American tribunal."

On their journey to China, Kona and Kuja, bound together by fate, stumble upon the trail of the Floating Island, promised land of plenty. Pema's story is about lost love, while her husband speaks of homesick Japanese soldiers in Manipur and the Naga hills during World War II. The Prophet takes us back to the quest for the Floating Island, leading us to the little girl's story as she sets out to fetch water and chances upon something quite unexpected. Drawing from various oral storytelling and folklore traditions, and with influences ranging from Commando war comics to World War II history and Buddhist art, Parismita Singh creates a world that's magical and yet very real. Exquisite in terms of both narrative and artwork, The Hotel at the End of the World marks a new height in graphic fiction in India.\""

Meanwhile, Carlos's mother Isabel (\"Chabela\") is in a tough underworld cabaret talking about how she hates her life and how her husband abandoned her when he got rich, though Carlos doesn't know this. Eventually the four friends arrive at the same establishment and find Chabela fighting off a drunk customer. The man hits her and Carlos wades in, knocking him down. The man pulls a gun and tries to shoot Carlos, but Isabel gets between them and is shot. Carlos throws a bottle and apparently kills the man.

He tries to draw the fire of the outlaws away from the house, but he is outnumbered six to one. Suddenly the gunfight is interrupted by the appearance of a peddler's wagon. The driver is singing at the top of his lungs, which for some reason causes the marauders to flee. The singer introduces himself as Ben Weber, a music teacher wishing to set up shop in Purple Valley. Introductions complete, the two check on the Rumsons, whos home is in flames. Wayne arranges for Weber to take the Rumsons into town. Miss Rumson seems to recognize Ben Weber, but he denies ever being in Purple Valley before. A few days later, John Wayne meets Miss Rumson on the way to a music lesson, and it's obvious that there's a romance budding. While in the barber shop, Wayne hears gunfire and singing as the bank is being robbed, and begins to think Ben may be the ringleader of the robbers. With the help of the sheriff, and the reluctant Miss Rumson, Wayne lays a trap for the gang during the stage shipment of some ore. While Miss Rumson is at her music lesson, the trap is sprung. Wayne catches the leader and brings him to town, where everyone realizes there seems to be two Ben Webers. One of them, the gang leader, is Ben's twin brother, Rafe."

Margaret begs her father to help her dig the woman up, but he doesn't believe her. Her father finally promises to go to the abandoned lot with her after lunch. Conversation turns to the neighbors, Helen and Charlie Nesbitt, who have been fighting. Margaret's father says he used to be engaged to Helen, and she had written him a song, but before he can sing it Margaret pulls him out the door. They go to the empty lot, but there is no screaming. Her father leaves and Margaret knocks on the neighbors' doors to see if anyone is missing, and indeed Helen Nesbitt is missing. On her way home she hears the voice again, this time singing. At home she sings the song for her father, who recognizes it as the one written for him. Finally convinced, he grabs his shovel and starts digging as Margaret looks on happily."
