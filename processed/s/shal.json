Chandru, sent to America for training by his company, decides to settle there while Girish joins a bank in Bangalore. Chandru marries Jamuna, a rich girl, and Girish is happy with Vinuta, from a middle class family, as his wife. For Gowramma dollar-rich Jamuna is everything and compared to her the other daughter in law, Vinuta, is good for nothing and is taunted at every opportunity. Life in America must be heavenly, dreams Gowramma. But a visit to the US to stay with Chandru is an eye opener for Gowramma. She not only realises that life in America is not all that rosy despite the earnings in dollars, Jamuna had neither any affection nor regard for her. Vinuta now shines as a model daughter in law. She decides to return to India to be with Vinuta but it is too late. Girish and Vinuta have already shifted to Dharwad to lead a tension free life away from Gowramma, who realises that dollar is not supreme after all.\""

Ernestillo says that if his father can see his wife and talk to her when he's drunk, he wants to do it too and talk to his mother. When the boys take the bottle from him, Ernestillo attacks with a hammer and manages to knock himself out. His friends put him in his bed, and return to school. The teacher wants to know what they found, and they say Ernestillo wasn't home. The teacher doesn't believe them, and questions them until he gets the truth. The teacher rushes to the carpentry shop, sees Ernestillo unconscious, and calls an ambulance. The boys wait at the hospital while the teacher looks for Mr. Vargas, the missing father of Ernestillo. The news that his son is in the Red Cross hospital shocks Mr. Vargas, and hearing that Ernestillo was trying to see his mother fills him with shame. In the hospital, Ernestillo recovers. The teacher brings Mr. Vargas to his son, and he begs his son's forgiveness."
