      "Summary (from SkyRiver): Through annotated illustrations, journals, maps, and dreamscapes, Peter Sís shows what life was like for a child who loved to draw, proudly wore the red scarf of a Young Pioneer, stood guard at the giant statue of Stalin, and believed whatever he was told to believe. But adolescence brought questions. Cracks began to appear in the Iron Curtain, and news from the West slowly filtered into the country. Sís learned about beat poetry, rock 'n' roll, blue jeans, and Coca-Cola. He let his hair grow long, secretly read banned books, and joined a rock band. Then came the Prague Spring of 1968, and for a teenager who wanted to see the world and meet the Beatles, this was a magical time. It was short-lived, however, brought to a sudden and brutal end by the Soviet-led invasion. But this brief flowering had provided a glimpse of new possibilities. Creativity could be discouraged but not easily killed."

Off goes Yûhi to rescue the spunky high-school coed Aya Mikage, who is under a death sentence by her own family! The rescue goes well, but soon Suzumi relegates Yûhi to protecting the high-spirited young girl. Little does Yûhi guess that two personalities dwell within Aya's body, herself and the legendary celestial maiden, Ceres! Although Yûhi complains about Aya all the time, why does he get so jealous when the handsome mystery-man Tôya is around? It couldn't be that he actually has feelings for Aya, could it?\""
