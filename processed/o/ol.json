To help him adapt to his new surroundings his mother urges him to join the 'Snow Geese,' a youth group led by a nonconformist priest who challenges Philippe to rethink his values. But as Philippe becomes more acquainted with the group and its charismatic leader, masks begin to slip, and he finds himself plunged into the centre of an unexpected drama. With his life turned upside-down, he seeks comfort in reading, and manages to find his bearings again when he discovers the old-fashioned adventure series of Jack Bowmore. Killing Velazquez is an autobiographical tale that gives us a glimpse into the complexities of manipulation and reminds us that sometimes an old book can actually save a life.\""

Teneshad eventually traps the couple in the house. Helen escapes into the arms of policemen who search the place, unable to find any sign of Danny or Teneshad. It is then revealed that Teneshad has hidden Danny in a soundproof cellar, where Mr. Sylvestre is also tied up and begging for death."

He gets fed up and breaks the mangler on purpose, so Grandma puts together a bigger one out of steam roller parts and makes Dan and Jasper manufacture sheet metal out of old cars and other scrap."

The white man in the blue mountains must leave, she says, or he will be killed. There are only 15 days until winter snow is expected. Joe takes the warning seriously, and rides up into the mountains to look for the man. The man turns out to be Bruce Altman, an old friend. It starts to snow early, and the two are stuck in Altman's cabin for the winter. Altman's story is that he was out hunting with his young son Tom, six years earlier, when Tom saw an Indian, panicked, and killed her. She was out picking berries. Bruce told Tom never to admit he did it, and Bruce took the blame for the crime himself. The incident led to the killing of two other white families by the Indians. The people of the town, Lone Pine, were about to lynch Bruce as the cause of the Indian attacks, so he went into hiding. Unbeknownst to Bruce, Tom has stood up in church and told the truth within the past year, to clear his father's name. The brother of the dead girl is still hunting Bruce, but Giddap intercedes and explains the situation to the brother. Bruce goes home."

      "Summary: The Redcoat soldiers arrest a man in the street who complains loudly of his fate, but when he is taken to the commanding officer it turns out he's an undercover agent, a traitor turning over a list of patriots' names. Lord Marmaduke Langsburry, an emisary direct from the King in London, witnesses the transaction and asks to see the list. Lord Langsburry pockets the list, then removes his beard to reveal that he is indeed Captain Swing. In short order the traitor is dead, and the fine carriage that brought \"Langsburry\" has left at a gallop. The British soldiers take off after the carriage, making it easy for Swing to sneak out of the headquarters to hide with his old friend Professor Griffith. The professor is puzzling over an old Rosicrucian book he bought from an antiquarian book dealer in Strasbourg. The reading isn't going well since it's Greco-Latino-Hebraic in runic characters. By chance, a soldier has seen Swing enter Griffith's house, so the soldiers come and the two have to flee. Also there is a sinister-looking bald man lurking in the house looking for a chance to steal the book. The professor takes the book with him, and they ride to Fort Ontario. Betty sets the professor up with a place to study. The creepy bald man returns to his home as well, on Black Skull Mountain, which is not far from Fort Ontario. He thinks awhile, then sends one of his superstitious Black servants, named Mumbulah, to go to Fort Ontario on Lake Ontario and retrieve the book, no matter whose life it costs. Meanwhile Griffith suddenly figures out the book, and it makes him crazy. He babbles nonsense and ancient-sounding words, and tries to kill Mister Bluff's dog, Pouik, by hanging it by the neck with a rope. Griffith's raving is so violent they have to tie him up. Mumbulah arrives at the fort and tries to steal the book, but gets locked up for his trouble. Hibou thinks sorcery is involved. Taking the book, Swing rides out from Lake Ontario for a few hours to a mountain cave full of books, bottles and a smoking brazier. Swing asks the wise man there to take a look at the book, and the wise man is interested. He says to come back in a few days when he's studied the book. Meanwhile, the strange bald man from Black Skull Mountain shows up at Fort Ontario asking for lodging. As he enters both Griffith and Mumbulah can be heard raving from their respective lockups, and Mister Bluff wonders if it might be the weather causing it. Hibou says that Indians lose their spirit in captivity too, and in sympathy lets Mumbulah out for some exercise. Mumbulah sees his master and immediately commits suicide by jumping from a tower. Then the bald man hypnotizes Betty from behind without her having even seen him. He tells her to go to town and buy a blue dress, and when she leaves the fort on foot he kidnaps her. When Swing comes back from delivering the book to his guru, a ransom note is found. The Rosicrucian book must be brought to Black Skull Mountain in exchange for Betty's life. Swing, Bluff and Hibou retrace Swing's path to retrieve the book, and arrive just as the wise man has deciphered it. He also starts raving and has to be tied up. The bald man gets excited when he mentally feels the book approaching, the book that was \"stolen from them at Tubingen.\" The man tries to capture Swing rather than release Betty, and in the struggle the book and the whole house are burned to ashes. At that moment both of the raving scholars are released from their spells miles apart. They get together at Fort Ontario and agree that the destruction of the book was a good thing. The one from the mountain, the one that Swing calls \"master,\" quotes Shakespeare: \"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosopy.\""

      "Summary: Giddap Joe rides into Axonville, and the town appears deserted. The men of the town are waiting in ambush, however, and Giddap soon has a noose around his neck and is headed for a lynching. Then a little girl, Julie Copping, cries out that Joe is her friend, and the townspeople relent. They had thought that Joe was part of a gang chasing Jim and Rose Copping, Julie's parents. Julie gives Joe the map to her father's gold strike. Joe decides he'd better go help his old friend Jim, so he thanks the townspeople for the loan of the necktie, takes it off, and prepares to leave. Before he can start, Lou Marks knocks him down and steals the map. In flashback, we learn that after Copping found the gold, the crooked sheriff of the town of Garriot has tried to steal his claim. Copping had shot \"sheriff\" Kaye in the arm, and Copping had spent three years in jail for it. Upon his release, Kaye was waiting with to cronies to continue the pursuit of Copping's gold. In the present, Loe Marks volunteers to join Giddap Joe as he rides out to find the Coppings. Marks is sure that Joe didn't see him when he stole the map. In the mountains, Rose Copping's horse is frightened by a rattlesnake, and she falls to the ground and is threatened by the snake. She wants Jim to shoot the snake, but he is sure that the sound of the shot would bring Kaye and his men straight to them. He lassos the snake neatly around its \"neck\" and throws it aside. Rose's horse's leg is broken, and Jim won't shoot it for the same reason, but Rose shoots it out of compassion. Sure enough, the couple is captured in a trice and threats to Rose soon elicit another map from Jim. At the entry to the cave where the gold is, Kaye stops and sends one of his men in to check the truth of Copping's story. The man doesn't come out, so Kaye sends another man in. Giddap Joe and Lou Marks (Lou having had a change of heart) were waiting inside the cave and have overpowered the two men. Joe then steps out of the cave and arrests Kaye."

In order to save Uncle Scrooge's money, Donald calls Huey, Louie and Dewey to come help move the money to Scrooge's newly acquired reservoir on Cedar Green. After all the money is safely moved away from the Beagle Boys, Uncle Scrooge surrounds the reservoir with fences, booby traps and land mines. Soon the Beagle Boys find him and devise a plan to break the dam and flood the money out of the reservoir. After they succeed, Uncle Scrooge convinces them to dive into the money head first, which knocks them all unconscious and gives Scrooge time to get all his money back."

While tracking down clues to the killer's identity, the first shots of the Revolution are fired, and Revere finds himself fighting a war on two fronts in a struggle to save his family. Revere battles a marauding band of outlaw Redcoats led by a bloodthirsty general, rescues a damsel in distress, and saves a lost soul from demons of the past. All of this sets the stage for a climactic battle at the Old North Church, where enemies become allies in an effort to save the land from this unspeakable terror. And in the end, Revere finds the fate of his beloved wife lies in the hands of the only werewolf he couldn't bring himself to kill."

      "Summary: Olga Gottmann tells the story of how her father fled to South America in 1945, and how she was raised with three siblings to be part of a new Aryan super-race, joined the Champions (with her sister Flare), first fought Sonya Ernesaks, and met the Olympian gods. Now she thinks a super-murderer at large in Germany must be her missing amateur Egyptologist brother, Tomas. In chapter 4, titled 'Blood Relations,' Olga and Willy Reismann battle with the evil group Demon. Karl May and Old Shatterhand are mentioned. They find Tomas Gottmann in a pyramid in Karlsruhe, playing the cello."

As she sees her older sister Marianne dating, she realizes she has been denying her inner femininity. Then Dan comes home. Dan is a childhood friend back from college for a break, and he tries to persuade Leslie to act and dress like a girl. He even tries to kiss her, but she rebuffs him. Later when Leslie sees Dan out with Marianne she realizes she has loved Dan all along. Leslie overhears Marianne telling their father that she and Dan are a serious couple, and decides to make Dan jealous by getting a makeover. She returns home looking elegant to find Dan waiting for her. He and Marianne had never cared for each other, but they had agreed to go out in the hope of persuading Leslie to look and act like a girl. Blissfully happy, Leslie kisses Dan and renounces her immature, boyish ways."
