      "Summary (by Kristine Baclawski): John Wayne comes upon a raid on the homestead of Mr. Rumson and his daughter. He tries to draw the fire of the outlaws away from the house, but he is outnumbered six to one. Suddenly the gunfight is interrupted by the appearance of a peddler's wagon. The driver is singing at the top of his lungs, which for some reason causes the marauders to flee. The singer introduces himself as Ben Weber, a music teacher wishing to set up shop in Purple Valley. Introductions complete, the two check on the Rumsons, whos home is in flames. Wayne arranges for Weber to take the Rumsons into town. Miss Rumson seems to recognize Ben Weber, but he denies ever being in Purple Valley before. A few days later, John Wayne meets Miss Rumson on the way to a music lesson, and it's obvious that there's a romance budding. While in the barber shop, Wayne hears gunfire and singing as the bank is being robbed, and begins to think Ben may be the ringleader of the robbers. With the help of the sheriff, and the reluctant Miss Rumson, Wayne lays a trap for the gang during the stage shipment of some ore. While Miss Rumson is at her music lesson, the trap is sprung. Wayne catches the leader and brings him to town, where everyone realizes there seems to be two Ben Webers. One of them, the gang leader, is Ben's twin brother, Rafe."
