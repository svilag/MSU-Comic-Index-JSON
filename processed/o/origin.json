Will the detectives save themselves and solve the mystery in time? In 'A Friend in Need,' the detectives split apart over multiple cases, one involving Raymond's friend, Ben Crenshaw, who's turning into a bully. With so many cases to solve, the Scrapyard Detectives have to work especially hard. But with so much prejudice, can they still work together as a team?\""
