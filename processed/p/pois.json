      "Summary: Near the town of Nugget Gulch, Lucky Luke meets a bearded man who calls himself John the Philanthropist. John says he's a peaceful man, and that the notches on his revolver aren't his, because he just found it and doesn't really use it well. When a cobra comes from behind a rock and John draws and kills it in one swift motion, Lucky Luke has to wonder about his story. In Nugget Gulch a horse race is planned for the next day. Since John and Lucky Luke are both low on money, they both decide to enter. John has seen Jolly Jumper run, and knows he can't beat such a horse, but he enters the race anywhow. Betting is heavy on the race, and a series of colorful charcters are entered, including a Mexican rider named \"Pedro Nice Chink\" riding a mule named \"Flower of the Orient,\" and a overweight man called \"Texas Slim.\" When Lucky Luke goes to get Jolly Jumper for the race, he finds the horse missing. The race starts without Lucky Luke. John the Philanthropist's horse is black, until a rain shower washes the stain off and the stolen Jolly Jumper is revealed. Lucky Luke whistles, and Jolly Jumper dumps John into a rain barrel. Lucky Luke and Jolly Jumper are win the race together, inspired by an electric shock after a collision with a telegraph pole. John steals all the money and runs for it on his own horse. Lucky Luke telegraphs ahead to Rattlesnake Valley, and has \"poison\" signs put on all the water holes in the desert. John is soon crazy with thirst and easily caught. Lucky Luke has him shaved and he turns out to be the wanted outlaw Joe La-Gâchette."

      "\"This book contains the second half of the epic Sanctuary story line, which spanned over two years of Drew Hayes' Poison Elves series. In Guild War, the elvin assassin Lusiphur has been captured by the Eye of the Lins (a rival guild run by police lieutenant Vido), whose sole purpose is to exterminate every last Sanctuary member. Struggling to stay alive, Lusiphur manages to escape and return to Sanctuary in time to help stage a preemptive strike on the vigilante organization. The climactic result is a definitively chaotic, bloody battle on the streets of Mandratha. In Strange Days, Lusiphur's ex-wife Hyena returns to wreak havoc on the rogue elf's already-inextricable life. Plus, the indestructible E'jja finally tracks down Lusiphur, whom the E'jja has sworn to kill, causing Sanctuary leaders Morachi and Talon to rethink Lusiphur's membership. Unfortunately, the only way to retire from Sanctuary is to die or be killed. All this, as well as the single most shocking event in Poison Elves history, makes volume 6 an essential tome.\""

The railroad's lawyers have his number, and conspire to send a fake swami to the hospital. The swami tells Luke he has to pick a sprig of local mint and hop back and forth over the railroad track in order to win his lawsuit against the railroad. The lawyers film the hopping, show it in court, and send Luke on his way. And the local mint turns out to be poison ivy. This story is humorous relief in a comic that is mostly serious crime stories."

      "Summary (from SkyRiver): This new collection features four tales of Gotham City in Batman's absence. First, a wave of heroes arrive in Gotham City with hopes of helping stem the tide of chaos threatening to overwhelm everybody! Starring Huntress, Batgirl, Misfit, Ragman, Manhunter and many others. But will these heroes succeed or become victims? Then, with Gotham City in a state of emergency, one man has stood firm against the criminal element in Gotham, Police Commissioner James Gordon. Now, Gordon and his police department must reclaim Gotham and take down Mister Freeze without the assistance of Batman. In the third story, Bat-villains including Catwoman, the Riddler, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, The Penguin and Ra's Al Ghul are on the loose. But will they work together to take down Gotham City, or destroy each other? Finally, in the heart of Arkham Asylum, will administrator Dr. Jeremiah Arkham fall prey to the madness that has plagued so many of his inmates? Or will he usher in a new era for Gotham's most haunted institution?"
