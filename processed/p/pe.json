Though the Khmer Rouge broke her family apart and left her parents poor and infirm, Shake Girl has a dream, to become a dancer and singer in karaoke videos. She has beauty and talent. She is only fourteen. Her idol is Piseth Pilika, a classically trained dancer and actress whose charm has captivated all of Cambodia. Shake Girl wishes nothing more than to follow in Pilika's footsteps and unfortunately, she will. First, she must make it out of the streets of Phnom Penh, find a way to support her family and navigate the treacherous world of Cambodian karaoke clubs, which are filled with corrupt officials, former Khmer Rouge officers and men with unlimited power. Two men will present themselves to Shake Girl, each claiming to have her best interests at heart, though they have vastly different ways of showing it. And only one will be there for her when she loses everything. In a nation where ancient traditions and institutions have been shattered by war, where men scramble to possess power, money and women of beauty, the benevolent forces of ancient Apsara statues direct their gazes toward Shake Girl. In their weathered expressions of patience and wisdom, they remind her that peace and beauty can be found only on the inside.\""
