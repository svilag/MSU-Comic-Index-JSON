He is hoping to find something at the site of a UFO landing, but loses his footing and is injured. An alien heals him and explains that his ship is normally invisible. Nyxly repays the alien by knocking him out and taking his ship. The first encounter goes badly for Superman, who leaves and shows up catatonic in the WGBS Building. The alien arrives and begins treatment for a brain short circuit. Nyxly raises havok and Jimmy gets an idea from the alien's comment that Superman would be in a suggestible state until he has healed. They give Superman a remote earpiece and Jimmy directs Superman's assault, followed by Lois, then by Edge. After the battle the alien diagnoses the problem as Kryptonian Sleeping Sickness, against which he was never vaccinated because he left Krypton before it was scheduled."
