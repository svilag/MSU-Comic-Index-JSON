They are then captured by the complementary all-man civilization called the Omks. The Swats attack and rescue The Mercenary, but it's too late for their sister who's been beheaded. It was the Omks who put her out for the monster to eat in the first place. In the Swat country, The Mercenary is taken before the giant queen for a decision as to whether he should be kept alive to breed a new princess. The decision is negative, but the warrior women rebel, kill the queen, and decide to keep The Mercenary as a shared drone. He escapes when their society, now without a queen, gets preoccupied with politics."
