The cow won't go home with the rest of the village herd. Finally he ties it with a chain, but it drags him to a fairy grotto. The fairy says he is courageous, thanks him for pasturing her cow, and says if he brings an empty bag the next day she'll fill it with a reward. The bag is heavy after she fills it, and she tells him he must have patience and not open it until he gets all the way home. Here Patchou fails, and when he opens it a fortune in gold coins takes flight. He manages to catch a few. Series title from contents page: \"Contés de Sorcellerie.\""

The Chef has stolen an ambulance and Moreau has sprained an ankle, so Barelli, Inspector Lapiste, and the ambulance driver give chase. The third ambulance they catch is the right one, but it's empty. They find Randor in a doctor's office near the abandoned vehicle, but not the Chef. Randor is soon kidnapped again from the doctor's office. This doctor is a plastic surgeon, and he is working for the Chef. A secret passage from the doctor's bathroom leads to a chase through tunnels. The Chef gets away, but Randor is recovered and Barelli ends up in a basement cabaret."
