The Lord is hard to track, though, even for someone whose soul has been merged with a near-omnipotent supernatural entity called Genesis. To pick up the trail, Jesse needs to get inside his own head for a one-on-one talk with his guest - and for that, a fistful of peyote taken under the open Arizona sky seems just the ticket. What's waiting for him in Monument Valley, however, is something much less spiritual: an entire U.S. Army tank regiment, commandeered by the newly elevated Allfather of the Grail, Herr Starr. Determined to harness the power of Genesis for himself, Starr is willing to use everything in the American military arsenal to force Jesse to his will - and neither side is going to walk away from this showdown without taking heavy casualties."

Though Dante believes that the Kraken is only an immortal and troublesome beast, the Church suspects that it is actually Satan himself. In the bunker are a radar station, to watch for the Kraken, and a pulpit, so the exorcist can preach to it. Dante, with some of his men, and the priest's obnoxious assistant are also locked in for the duration. After nine hours of impassioned preaching the Kraken arrives, and the priest seems to die. After hitting the bunker a few times the Kraken leaves. The priest then comes alive again, and is shot by his assistant who thinks the priest is now possessed. The priest, dying once more, says that the assistant is the one who is possessed."

The deva also told him that if the necklace broke the person who repaired it would die. It happened as the king feared. The necklace broke and Queen Chellana, who was wearing it, insisted that it be repaired. Would anyone string the stones, even for a big reward, and risk death? And if there was such a man, whould the king honour his promise and give the reward to his heirs? This Jain story is based on a retelling of tales from the Agamas (Jain texts) by Muni Mahendrakumar.\""

      "Summary: Télé awakes to a power failure with only his/her shadow for company. Télé follows a parade of prehistoric looking, Genet-quoting animal monsters, which joins a group of women truckdrivers and their trucks. A mysterious bodiless shadow is also following the parade. Télé is captured by the kamioneuses (or camioneuses). The truckdrivers are then set upon by a rival gang, the précieuses (or gracieuses), who drive smaller cars. While trying to escape in the confusion with a Proust-quoting monster, Télé is captured by the new gang, but freed by a kiss from the mysterious shadow. Télé flees with the monsters, pursued by both gangs while the city begins to flood. The monsters (quoting Robert Desnos) and Télé make it to a market in the suburbs for a good meal underwater, chewing their literature. The kamioneuses refuel and have a beer. Most of the rest of the story is underwater, with fish going by. Télé is captured by a band of rockeuses (or rockettes), and the animals flee. Both the kamioneuses and the gracieuses see the animals without Télé, and the camioneuses soon attack the rockettes, trying to retrieve Télé. The rockettes escape on their Vespas with a wounded Télé. Télé is left in the care of Garance, the dauphine of the rockettes, who wants to stay home and read comics anyhow. Her pile of comics includes Popeye, Spirou, Tintin and The Spirit. Garance takes Télé on a flying scooter ride, and they visit the Fairy of Domesticity. The fairy hooks Télé up to a futuramama machine and makes predictions. Télé's shadow asks the fairy's shadow about the mysterious shadow. The fairy makes a pay phone ring where the shadow is and she (with the animals quoting Robert Desnos again) is reunited with Télé's shadow. Télé leaves, with the animals quoting Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, to find the shadow's body. The three gangs declare peace. While Télé is still searching, the animals quote Lou Reed &amp; Philip K. Dick. Climbing above the water, Télé finds his/her true love stuck in another dimension, but crashes through to a happy ending.",

Instead, the baby Zarathushtra smiled, and it was predicted correctly that he would preach love and justice to the world, but would have a hard time convincing vengeful rivals.
