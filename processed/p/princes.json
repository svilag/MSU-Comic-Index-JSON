At registration he meets a classmate named Stefani Stoul, and in class the next day he asks her out. Another classmate hears Zwanna's definition of ethics in class (\"we kill our enemies\"), and reports Zwanna to Wilma Femse, chief of the Focal Spy Company (FSC). FCS is apparently part of an international conspiracy that King Siafra warned him Zwanna about. The other three agents of FSC are called the Black Widows, named Georgina Shrubs, Rhoda Rayban, and Jamie Carter. All four are white transvestites. That night Zwanna's \"Zulu sense\" wakes him and he rushes out to find three white thugs beating up a black couple. One thung has a Hitler moustache, one has a swastika tattoo, and one wears a Confederate flag. All three are skinheads. Zwanna shouts the word \"Zhaab!\" and is transformed into a near-naked warrior with a spear and necklaces. The thugs are quickly killed. In the office of the Black Widows, the four transvestites make plans to catch Zwanna, focusing on his radicalism and his sexuality. In an office closet they have the corpse of W.R. Tolbert of Liberia. Soon Zwanna is kidnapped and chained for their admiration, and Stefani is brought out and threatened. This is too much, Stefani faints, and Zwanna shouts \"Zhaab!\" This gives him the power to rip the chains from the concrete and kill three of the transvestites. He then shouts \"Chaka!\" which enables him to leap ahead of the final transvestite and kill him. Zwanna picks up the unconscious Stefani and heads for home."

The Kaurava prince, Duryodhana, recognised his ability at archery and made him king of Anga. For this, Karna remained loyal to him till the end. He met an untimely end at the hands of his brother Arjuna in the Mahabharata War.\"",

He needed divine weapons, such as the Gandiva bow, with its inexhaustible supply of arrows, and a special war chariot. Most importantly, he needed the blessings of the gods, especially Lord Vishnu.\"",

The stranger grabs a spear and kills the dragon himself because a wizard has told him if he does so, then burns the dragon's heart with some of his lady love's hair, it'll save her life. Her name is Princess Anne, and she's sick. The Night Faces warn the stranger that there will be side effects, but he's in love and won't listen.

      "Summary: While out in public watching a parade, Wonder Woman is made drowsy by a bright light. She wakes up in a nearby park with an indestructible mask on her face, and it's ticking like a bomb. She tries extreme force, friction, cold and heat, but the mask won't come off. Then she notices a message in Braille on the surface of the mask, which says it will explode after 6 hours on her face. The media spread the story of her exploding mask. She visits every print shop that can print in Braille until she comes to one printer who doesn't seem afraid of her. She sits with him until the deadline, and sure enough, he jumps up and defuses the mask. The printer is wearing a mask too, and he is revealed as the master criminal Machino.",

She wakes up in a nearby park with an indestructible mask on her face, and it's ticking like a bomb. She tries extreme force, friction, cold and heat, but the mask won't come off. Then she notices a message in Braille on the surface of the mask, which says it will explode after 6 hours on her face. The media spread the story of her exploding mask. She visits every print shop that can print in Braille until she comes to one printer who doesn't seem afraid of her. She sits with him until the deadline, and sure enough, he jumps up and defuses the mask. The printer is wearing a mask too, and he is revealed as the master criminal Machino.",
