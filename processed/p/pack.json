      "Summary: Mickey gets a package from West Africa, and inside is a young African named Thursday. In the funny-animal universe of Mickey Mouse, where everyone is some kind of anthropomorphic animal, Thursday is the opposite, an \"animalized\" human. He is a trickster, interested only in food and fun, and quite a difficult house guest. Only Goofy can calm him down, and it develops as a kind of punch line to the story that Goofy closely resembles a sacred totem pole from West Africa. Toward the end of the story Thursday won't stop playing a drum, and Mickey tries to get rid of him by giving him to an African American jazz band, Cal Cabaway's Congoliers. The band, drawn as dark-skinned dogs, rejects Thursday because they can't get him to stop drumming. It turns out that the drumming was a message to his brother in Africa requesting shipment of his pet elephant. When the elephant arrives things get even crazier. Eventually, though, Thursday leaves on his own because the people in Mickey's country aren't letting him have enough fun."

      "Summary (by Amy Lazet): California miner Homer Burke has raised a grizzly bear, named it Buster, and trained it to kill other miners so Homer can steal their gold. The miners in the Los Metales region become fearful of the bear that kills miners and steals their gold, and it is into this atmosphere that Steve and Packy arrive. They hear the story of the bear, but believe a human must be behind it. Homer hears them and plants some stolen gold in their belongings to frame them. Steve and Packy manage to escape the lynch mob, however, and Steve retreats to Sundown Valley where he keeps the stallion and Comanche clothing that turn him into Straight Arrow. Straight Arrow returns to the scene and lays traps for Buster. After being stabbed, Buster slinks back to Homer, and in a dazzling display of courage and skill Straight Arrow kills the bear and captures Homer. Having ensured justice, Straight Arrow rides from the town, uttering his characteristic cry, \"Kaneee-Wahaahhh!\""
