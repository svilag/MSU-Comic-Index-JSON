Allergy talks Binky into forming a social club for girls to keep Sherwood's mind off Peggy. It looks like the club will be popular, but Binky didn't invite Peggy to be a member. She's angry at him. The club meets, asks Binky to leave the room, and elects Peggy president. Then Peggy explains that she wasn't angry at him because of the club, she was angry because he didn't accept the two tickets to the musical that Sherwood was trying to give him."
