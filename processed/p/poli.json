The Angle is a crook who always has a surprise idea, an \"angle,\" to avoid capture. Darrel gets arrested, but sneaks out as Doll Man to work on the case. Hackie Joe Bilber remembers where he dropped their man off, at a hideout where his pal Small-Time is waiting. Doll Man hides and watches while established gangsters Boxy and Shoulders offer to cooperate with them. Doll Man squirts seltzer at Boxy and Shoulders, which starts a brawl. Meanwhile the police have decided that Darrel Dane is The Angle, so when Doll Man's phone call comes in they think they know who to look for. The police try to arrest Dane, and use tear gas, but Darrel changes back to Doll Man. Things get sorted out, and the new \"crime combine\" has been prevented.",

Memín plans to pretend they are musicians. The white boys sing, however badly, and Memín holds it together with his natural rhythm. Meanwhile, Carlos's mother Isabel (\"Chabela\") is in a tough underworld cabaret talking about how she hates her life and how her husband abandoned her when he got rich, though Carlos doesn't know this. Eventually the four friends arrive at the same establishment and find Chabela fighting off a drunk customer. The man hits her and Carlos wades in, knocking him down. The man pulls a gun and tries to shoot Carlos, but Isabel gets between them and is shot. Carlos throws a bottle and apparently kills the man. Isabel is not badly hurt and tells her son to run before the police get there."

Unlike Larry, Jeff is a smooth talker and she falls into a routine of champagne-filled dancing dates with him. One day Larry visits her and proposes marriage. Lois is ambivalent, confused by juggling two such opposite men. One night she realizes she has left her ring at work and makes a midnight attempt to recover it. In the dark office Lois stumbles upon a group of foreigners up to some fishy business. They catch her as she is phoning Larry for help, and out walks Jeff, and suddenly she realizes he's a spy. In order to shut her up, they plan her murder. Larry breaks in with a swarm of policemen in the nick of time to save the day. Lois decides Larry is the type of man she wants to marry."

Hounded by the police from London to Marseilles and then to India, he faced the most trying situations in his untiring effort to fight British rule. But even the despair and darkness of Kala Pani did not dim his courage. Veer Savarkar found the most unique ways to motivate his prison mates and keep their belief alive in an independent India.\""

The hero of the album <a href=\"/rri/krri/kra.htm#kraken\"><em>Kraken</em></a> is police Lt.\n        Dante, who patrols what is both literally and figuratively the\n        underworld of the city of Metropol. \"Sanitation Police\" are one\n        of the forces operating in the post-catastrophe world of Pepe\n        Moreno's <a href=\"/rri/rrri/reb.htm#ebel\"><em>Rebel,</em></a> though law and order don't seem to be present to be enforced. <p><strong>Police in detective and urban stories</strong><br/>\n        In the album <a href=\"/rri/grri/go.htm#between\"><em>The\n        Go-Between,</em></a> Kelly Green is the widow of a police\n        officer and solves his murder by getting involved with his\n        former partner and superiors. In the album <a href=\"/rri/jrri/joe_q.htm#joesbar\"><em>Joe's Bar</em>,</a> Pepe the\n        undocumented alien lives in constant fear of the police.</p> <p><strong>Police in colonial and neo-colonial adventure\n        stories</strong><br/>\n        During World War I, Hugo Pratt's Corto Maltese runs into the\n        \"Leopard-Men of the Rufiji\" in the album <a href=\"/rri/crri/cort.htm#africa\"><em>Corto Maltese in\n        Africa</em></a> and learns that the mysterious organization is\n        actually a secret pan-African police force. In the album\n        <a href=\"/rri/irri/india.htm#ijelcdlf\"><em>Indiana Jones et la\n        Cité de al Foudre</em>,</a> there is a colonial policeman named\n        Blake, who turns out to be a villain.

The second time the police are\n        not really police, but right-wing thugs impersonating police,\n        and they try to make Condor disappear because he has ransom\n        money destined for the rebels. The South Seas French-colonial\n        police in <a href=\"/rri/arri/alla.htm#mome\"><em>Allaïve : un\n        Môme de Perdu</em></a> are good guys, working hard to solve a\n        mystery that involves a criminal European. In the comedic Jack\n        Palmer album <a href=\"/rri/erri/enj.htm#enqcor\"><em>L'Enquête\n        Corse,</em></a> Mr. Palmer is kidnapped by armed liberationists\n        who are soon in a faction fight about who gets to keep the\n        prisoner. The police arrive, arrest the prisoner, and are soon\n        in an inter-agency struggle that mirrors that of the\n        militants.</p> <p>See also</p> <ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/crri/cop.htm#cops\">Cops</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/drri/dep.htm#ties\">Deputies</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/drri/detectz.htm#ives\">Detectives</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/frri/f.htm#fbiagent\">FBI Agents</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/irri/insig.htm#tors\">Inspectors</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/mrri/marsh.htm#als\">Marshals</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/prri/police_a.htm#pcars\">Police Cars</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/prri/police_a.htm#pdogs\">Police Dogs</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/prri/police_a.htm#pstat\">Police Stations</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/prri/police_a.htm#pwomen\">Policewomen</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/rrri/rang.htm#rangers\">Rangers</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/rrri/roya.htm#rcmp\">Royal Canadian Mounted\n            Police</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/srri/sher.htm#iffs\">Sheriffs</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/trri/texa.htm#gers\">Texas Rangers</a><br/>\n            and\n          </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/arri/agent.htm#212\">Agent 212</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/brri/bada.htm#badgguys\">The Badge\n            Guys</a><br/>\n            and\n          </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/rri/crri/cob.htm#bjoe\">Cobb, Joe</a> (in Jump\n            Start)\n          </li>\n</ul>"
