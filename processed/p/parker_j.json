In contrast, Harry had always wilted under life's pressures and the strain of his father's domineering influence, unable to live up to Norman's expectations. Unfortunately, Harry remained unaware of his father's dark side as the Green Goblin until it was too late. Witnessing Norman's apparent death in battle with Spider-Man, Harry was driven to the brink of insanity. Assuming his late father's identity, he began a descent into madness that would haunt him his entire life, for only in death could he finally find peace. Now, for the first time ever in one volume, witness the startling tale of Harry's tragic demise.\""

      "Summary: Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen attend a demonstration given by a \"mental expert,\" a professor Z. Parker, who uses tape-recorded messages played to sleeping people to change their behavior. The professor calls this the \"power-of-suggestion.\" Jimmy sees Lois pestering Superman because she's in love with him, figures her attentions are unwelcome, and decides to free his pal from her by using the power-of-suggestion on Clark Kent. The idea is to get Lois married off and out of Superman's hair. It works, and Clark proposes, but Lois rejects him because of her crush on Superman. Jimmy then calls in Superman and tells him to reject Lois more firmly to clear the field for Clark, but of course Superman has been subject to the same power-of-suggestion. Lois thinks Superman's energetic proposals of marriage are just a cruel April Fool's Day joke, but when he comes back the next day she accepts. The wedding ceremony is almost complete when a distraction caused by Jimmy interrupts it, and then the suggestion wears off and Superman is saved."

Thanks to Steve Parkhouse's wonderfully vivid illustrations and Jim McCarthy's clever distillation of the script that rewrote rock 'n' roll and much else besides, the Pistols' story returns to the rough and tumble of the comic strip from which it derived so much of its initial inspiration. England's original punks explode from the pages with the same disrespect for authority that had the British establishment up in arms during the Queen's 25th anniversary jubilee. And no one would have enjoyed this take on the Pistols more than the tale's real casualty, Sid Vicious, who devoured comics almost as much as he did the destructive stuff."

      "\"Hollywood in the 1950s is a place of big glamour, small talk, and medium cool. The studios control everything, managing their actors' careers and massaging the image they present to the public. To do this, they need the press onboard to help wrangle the one aspect they can't control, gossip. This means the most powerful woman in Hollywood is Paige Turner, the celebrity columnist for one of America's most-read papers. Know for her outrageous headgear, Paige is often called The Mad Hatter, a nickname with a double meaning, since everyone wants to be invited to her publicity party. When a more salacious tabloid mentality creeps onto the newsstands, though, Paige sees some of her ground being threatened. And the studios see a roguish new element that might not want to play ball. At the top of this saucy new art form is Harry Richards, The Tabloid Dick, the guy with the snooping peepers who keeps getting the scoop. What begins as a war of words ends up being a knock-down, drag-out fight for the number one slot as the biggest rumor monger in entertainment.\""

She wakes up in a nearby park with an indestructible mask on her face, and it's ticking like a bomb. She tries extreme force, friction, cold and heat, but the mask won't come off. Then she notices a message in Braille on the surface of the mask, which says it will explode after 6 hours on her face. The media spread the story of her exploding mask. She visits every print shop that can print in Braille until she comes to one printer who doesn't seem afraid of her. She sits with him until the deadline, and sure enough, he jumps up and defuses the mask. The printer is wearing a mask too, and he is revealed as the master criminal Machino.",
