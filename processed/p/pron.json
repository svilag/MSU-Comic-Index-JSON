However, as World War II began, comic books evolved into a form of propaganda, providing information and education for both children and adults. Comics and Conflict examines how comic books were used to display patriotism, valor and adventure through war stories, and eventually to tell of the horrors of combat from World War II through the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\""
