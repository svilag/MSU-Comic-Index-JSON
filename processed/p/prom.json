For eight years he searches, and finally comes upon one of them, Herb Woodson, in Kansas. Woodson dies before he can say more than that the other two, Morrison and Bligh, have joined the cavalry. On the way to Bismark to join the cavalry himself at Fort Lincoln, Vickers meets a young woman named Molly. In the process he beats up a bullying Sergeant O'Hara, who was bothering her. Molly is traveling West to be with her father, Sam Quade, who is the sutler at Fort Lincoln, and whom she hardly knows. Vickers enlists as a private, and O'Hara is his sergeant, and trouble begins right away. The company is called out and soon pinned down by Sioux Indians, and Vickers makes it back to tell General Custer, their overall commander, the situation. Custer promotes him over O'Hara. Molly and John figure out that O'Hara is Morrison and that Molly's father is Bligh. Custer and most of the cavalry are then killed at the Little Big Horn, and Vickers becomes a lieutenant in what's left of the unit, and he has to marry Molly."

      "Summary: Middlebury College coed Jane Brooks has a crush on the school football hero, Roy Mason. Because she needs to work her way through school at the library, she doesn't have much opportunity for social activities. Then Roy comes into the library, asking for help in finding information for his term paper. When Jane tells her roommate Helen about the encounter, she is reminded that she isn't likely to be Roy's type. So Jane dates another student, Paul Clark, who is as serious and studious as she. When Paul tells her about his plans to go to graduate school and become a teacher, and that he hopes she will marry him, Jane says it's too soon to think about that. The next day Roy returns to the library for more help. By assisting him, she finds that Roy is more serious than she thought. He asks her to the prom and tells her that asking for help was just an excuse to get close to her, and so, the feelings are mutual."
