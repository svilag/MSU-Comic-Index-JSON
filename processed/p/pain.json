He recalls how Lana had some Pan-pipes which her father found with a statue of the god and how he experienced an excruciating pain when she blew on them. Later he looks in the mirror and finds he has grown horns. He realizes that the syrinx, or pipes, may be the cure but he has to find them because they have been stolen. To hide what has happened he adopts Batman's cowl and cape in place of his own cape. He uses the horns to capture the superstitious thief before the spell dissipates taking the horns with them. He tells Bruce about the episode and asks, \"How do you ever manage to scare anyone in that get-up of yours?\""
