Jimmy's letters try to cheer him up, but Fred starts realizing what being pitied feels like. Jimmy tells Fred about the lives of six of his friend that he has been exchanging letters with. Fred takes the problem to the JSA, saying, \"I want those kids to have a chance to prove that in spite of their handicaps, they are well-regulated, thinking, normal human beings!\" Fred compares a child with cerebral palsy to a general trying to control and army without adequate communications, but with the bravery to keep fighting. The JSA hatches a plan to involve Jimmy's friends in crime fighting, the heroes draw names, and off they go. At the end of the adventures the Society gets back together with Jimmy and Fred. All six of Jimmy's friends have proven their brains and courage, and the JSA is inspired to make a pledge, to treat the physically handicapped as \"fully our equals.\"",

Written by nonfiction comics mainstay Jim Ottaviani and brilliantly illustrated by First Second author Leland Myrick, Feynman tells the story of the great man's life from his childhood in Long Island to his work on the Manhattan Project and the Challenger disaster. Ottaviani tackles the bad with the good, leaving the reader delighted by Feynman's exuberant life and staggered at the loss humanity suffered with his death.\""

      "Summary (by Mary Walker): Luthor is back and a pair of his employees take over the WGBS station to issue a challenge for Superman to meet him at high noon the next day. The first engagement has Superman ending up imprisoned in Luthor's war suit which is programmed to discharge red solar energy whenever its prisoner tries to break free. He tries to contact Jimmy but Jimmy refuses to believe that Superman is imprisoned and the suit reinforces that with a manufactured image of Luthor. It tries to kill Jimmy and then threatens to kill anyone else Superman tries to contact. However Superman has left a message burned in Kryptonese on the wall, which Jimmy deciphers. Next day another strange creature (Trogar) comes to challenge Superman and Superman has to face him looking like and sounding like Luthor. He makes it sound like Luthor is giving Superman a testimonial. This is to much for Luthor's vanity, and soon the battle suit disappears releasing Superman. Trogar turns out to have been Supergirl in disguise.
