Luthor recalls being in prison having been tried as an adult and sentenced to 20 years of which he served 13 before parole. He would have served longer if they could have proven he killed Superboy. He wishes Superboy were still alive so he could 'have the pleasure of killing him all over again!'. Kent becomes more uncomfortable with his powerlessness with Lana thinking that it has become an obsession. She recalls how she and Pete Ross found the unconscious Superboy and got him home. Luthor stages a comeback with Superman there to meet him. Superman reveals how he tried to use the various forms of kryptonite to regain his powers and created a belt which gives him a semblance of them."

      "<strong>Summary:</strong> Tintin and Captain Haddock visit\n        police headquarters in Callao, Peru, to arrange for the rescue\n        of Professor Calculus when the ship Pachacamac arrives. They\n        discover that they are being followed. Thompson and Thomson\n        turn up as the ship is arriving. The ship comes in quarantined\n        with yellow fever, but Tintin doesn't believe it and swims out\n        to the ship that night. Tintin finds Calculus, but is himself\n        discovered and has to escape before he can rescue the\n        Professor. Tintin stays to watch the ship while Haddock goes\n        for reinforcements. The next morning Haddock and the\n        Thom(p)sons begin searching for Tintin, who has disappeared on\n        the track of Calculus' kidnappers. Haddock finds Tintin, who\n        has seen them take Calculus on a train that runs every other\n        day. In two days Tintin, Haddock and Snowy take the train and\n        find themselves isolated in the last car. After the train has\n        steamed to the top of a mountain their car mysteriously\n        uncouples and they have to jump or be killed. Finally reaching\n        the village where Calculus is being held, they find the Indians\n        uncooperative until Tintin rescues a boy from a bully. Then\n        Tintin gets the offer of a guide, and the man who has been\n        following them gives him a lucky talisman. Their guide turns\n        out to be the boy, Zorrino, that Tintin had befriended. The\n        first night out on the trail toward the Temple of the Sun,\n        Zorrino and the llamas disappear. Snowy tracks the kidnappers,\n        and Zorrino and the llamas are recovered. Snowy is then carried\n        away by a condor and must be rescued. The Indians who are\n        trying to stop them catch up again as Haddock, causing an\n        avalanche, manages by accident to roll them into snowballs and\n        over a cliff. The three friends and Snowy struggle through the\n        jungle and come upon a secret passage behind a waterfall, which\n        brings them directly into the Temple of the Sun. The temple is\n        fully staffed, and they are taken prisoner. They are taken\n        before The Inca, and though they try to explain they are slated\n        for death. Then Tintin shows the talisman he was given earlier.\n        The man who gave it to him turns out to be a priest in\n        attendance, and he explains Tintin's good nature. Zorrino is\n        saved, but the lot of Tintin and Haddock is only improved in\n        that they get to choose their own time of death. It must be\n        within thirty days. Tintin picks a time 18 days in the future,\n        at 11 A.M. Meanwhile Thompson and Thomson, having lost track of\n        Tintin, are dowsing for him with a pendulum, and have climbed\n        to the top of the Eiffel Tower. After seventeen days they have\n        followed their pendulum across the world and deep into a coal\n        mine. When the appointed hour comes, Tintin, Haddock and\n        Calculus are bound to stakes on a pile of firewood. Tintin has\n        predicted an eclipse and pretends to extinguish the sun, and\n        they go free. Tintin pleads then for the seven men in comas\n        back in Europe (see <em>The Seven Crystal Balls</em> ), and they\n        are released through the destruction of images of them kept by\n        the high priest. The friends leave for Europe with bags of gold\n        as Thomson and Thompson search Antarctica. <p>This summary is from <em>European Comics in English\n        Translation</em> (Jefferson, NC : McFarland &amp; Company, 2002).\n        Used with permission.<br/></p>",
