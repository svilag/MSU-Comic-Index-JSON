Harry is going to Africa, and has left his pet chimpanzee, Duke, in Ralph's care. Duke has been trained to play catch. Soon Ralph's wife, Alice, returns home from grocery shopping and is horrified to find the chimp in her home. The argument is broken up by the news that the baseball game has been called off. Alice challenges the boys' team to a game, but is missing one player. Duke is added to the girls' team. With the score tied at 0-0 at the bottom of the 9th inning, Duke comes up to bat and hits a home run."

      "Summary: Mickey gets a package from West Africa, and inside is a young African named Thursday. In the funny-animal universe of Mickey Mouse, where everyone is some kind of anthropomorphic animal, Thursday is the opposite, an \"animalized\" human. He is a trickster, interested only in food and fun, and quite a difficult house guest. Only Goofy can calm him down, and it develops as a kind of punch line to the story that Goofy closely resembles a sacred totem pole from West Africa. Toward the end of the story Thursday won't stop playing a drum, and Mickey tries to get rid of him by giving him to an African American jazz band, Cal Cabaway's Congoliers. The band, drawn as dark-skinned dogs, rejects Thursday because they can't get him to stop drumming. It turns out that the drumming was a message to his brother in Africa requesting shipment of his pet elephant. When the elephant arrives things get even crazier. Eventually, though, Thursday leaves on his own because the people in Mickey's country aren't letting him have enough fun."

Put in charge of the ship as a teenager after her father's death in a tragic accident, Tita must fight to overcome her youth and inexperience in order to become a fully-fledged Pet Shop Hunter, and to prove her father's faith in her correct. Fortunately, she is aided by her unyielding spirit, sound judgment and natural ability to sense approaching storms, as well as a loyal and capable crew who will risk anything to keep her safe and to help her achieve her goals. In this complete collection of Satoshi Urushihara's manga classic, we are drawn into the lives of Tita and her crew members one by one, just as we are entranced by their exciting encounters with the elusive creatures of the deep.\""
