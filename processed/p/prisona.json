The first engagement has Superman ending up imprisoned in Luthor's war suit which is programmed to discharge red solar energy whenever its prisoner tries to break free. He tries to contact Jimmy but Jimmy refuses to believe that Superman is imprisoned and the suit reinforces that with a manufactured image of Luthor. It tries to kill Jimmy and then threatens to kill anyone else Superman tries to contact. However Superman has left a message burned in Kryptonese on the wall, which Jimmy deciphers. Next day another strange creature (Trogar) comes to challenge Superman and Superman has to face him looking like and sounding like Luthor. He makes it sound like Luthor is giving Superman a testimonial. This is to much for Luthor's vanity, and soon the battle suit disappears releasing Superman. Trogar turns out to have been Supergirl in disguise. Luthor isn't exactly unhappy because the battle suit has given him a wealth of information about his enemy's physiology which he hopes to use in the next meeting."

On the spur of the moment, he puts it into his pocket. As the guard lives a solitary, monotonous life, the numbers on the paper awake his curiosity. To find out their hidden meaning could add a new meaning to his life as well, so the guard stumbles into situations in which the number or part of it seem to achieve a certain importance and offer him hints and possible solutions. And the numbers signal a radical change in his luck. He gets to know a woman, falls in love with her, and one night, in a casino, he wins a huge amount of money when gambling on these numbers. But the next morning, the woman and money have disappeared. The man goes in search of the woman and the money. But from that day on, his luck changes and the numbers bring him only bad luck, sending him inexorably into an abyss that he might not recover from.\"",
