The inhabitants of Spinachova, King Blozo's land, have fallen asleep and no one can wake them. The King convinces Popeye, Olive Oyl, Wimpy and Swee'pea to come to his country to rouse his sleeping people. Unbeknownst to them, the almost forgotten original people of the island of Spinachova, the Big-Eared Pygmies, have hatched a nefarious scheme. By crossing onions with huckleberries, they have developed \"rocakabye berries,\" which induce sleep. Popeye, the King, and Olive Oyl pretend to be asleep and are taken by the Pygmies. Olive convinces their leader to tell her why he has committed these dastardly deeds. The Pygmies don't like spinach, so they have captured King Blozo's subjects to plant the farms with carrots instead. In return for planting some carrots in addition to spinach the Pygmies agree to let their victims go, but it is up to Popeye and Olive to awaken everyone by tickling their feet with a special feather."

Now she thinks a super-murderer at large in Germany must be her missing amateur Egyptologist brother, Tomas. In chapter 4, titled 'Blood Relations,' Olga and Willy Reismann battle with the evil group Demon. Karl May and Old Shatterhand are mentioned.

The natives call themselves a super race, The Deros, and they call their underground caves Lemuria. The Deros say that one day the world will fear them. Their leader is Donnerwetter, one of Hitler's most infamous generals. The Nazi general has been grooming an underground army to take over the world. The Blackhawks can't let that happen. With a little ingenuity and a little lighter fuel they lock the super race in a chamber and let the Earth's core set them ablaze. The Blackhawks escape in the nick of time."

The other is a black-ops soldier willing to do whatever it takes to complete his mission. One holds life sacred above all else, while the other wouldn't hesitate to take a life if the job called for it. So what happens when these two enigmas cross paths? We'll never know because one of them has been dead for ten years. On the trail of a dangerous pyrokinetic, Batman pieces together a web of intrigue and murder that spans an entire decade. The key to it all is government killer Michael Cray, codenamed \"Deathblow.\" How will the Dark Knight Detective be able to solve this deadly mystery when the missing link has been gone for so long?"
