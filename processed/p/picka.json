      "Summary (from SkyRiver): The Battle of Gettysburg is one of the most famous battles in American history, and is widely recognized as the turning point of the Civil War. A landmark event in United States history, it accounted for the most casualties of any battle during the war and spelled the beginning of the end for the Confederacy. In this powerful graphic history, Wayne Vansant describes the period leading up to the Battle of Gettysburg, as well all of the major military events on July 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, including the famous fight for Little Round Top and the death march known as Pickett's Charge. He paints portraits of each army's leaders, among them Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, George Meade, and the then little-known Joshua Chamberlain. Vansant concludes a few months later at the dedication of the Soldier's National Cemetery in November 1863, when Abraham Lincoln delivered one of the most famous speeches of all time: the Gettysburg Address."

He waits, longing to catch sight of his beloved Doe Eyes, the Pawnee maid, as she picks berries. He is not the only one watching. Bounty hunter Joel Turk sees her and decides to bribe the invading Oglala Sioux tribe into kidnapping her. The Sioux attack the Pawnee village the next morning, and Arrowhead counterattacks. He is too late to prevent the kidnapping, so he follows the Sioux and waits for dusk to free Doe Eyes. The attempt is discovered but the Pawnee couple manages to escaped, taking Turk's horse with them. Arrowhead takes Doe Eyes home. She declares her love for him, but he tells her his life as an outcast is not one for her to share. He leaves, knowing she will never be safe as long as Turk is alive."

      "Summary: The story opens at \"Terre Brulée,\" the ranch of Giddap Joe. An Indian boy named Wa Wa is hauling water for the horses when he comes upon White Deer, a girl who brings a warning. The white man in the blue mountains must leave, she says, or he will be killed. There are only 15 days until winter snow is expected. Joe takes the warning seriously, and rides up into the mountains to look for the man. The man turns out to be Bruce Altman, an old friend. It starts to snow early, and the two are stuck in Altman's cabin for the winter. Altman's story is that he was out hunting with his young son Tom, six years earlier, when Tom saw an Indian, panicked, and killed her. She was out picking berries. Bruce told Tom never to admit he did it, and Bruce took the blame for the crime himself. The incident led to the killing of two other white families by the Indians. The people of the town, Lone Pine, were about to lynch Bruce as the cause of the Indian attacks, so he went into hiding. Unbeknownst to Bruce, Tom has stood up in church and told the truth within the past year, to clear his father's name. The brother of the dead girl is still hunting Bruce, but Giddap intercedes and explains the situation to the brother. Bruce goes home."
