Volume 1 follows the beginnings of comics and some of the comic book characters that were popular during the turn of the century, World War I, the Roaring '20s and the Great Depression. Volume 2 deals with the superheroes and characters with superhuman powers that are still popular today, just as they were 40 and 50 years ago. It also discusses how the 1950s and 1960s inspired the creation of a whole new cast of comic characters for a baby boom generation. Volume 3 looks at the underground movement of the 1960s and the alternative-style comics it produced that ferociously attacked society. It also discusses the superheroes of the 1970s and 1980s and the impact of the Punk movement on comics. Volume 4 wraps up the series with the new changes in comics, from superheroes who are becoming more human to dealing with ecological disasters and drugs. The program also looks at the future of comics and features today's young artists and writers.",
