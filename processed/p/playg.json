This is how this land has remained, until 314 dapper-looking gentlemen rain down from the sky and set off in different directions to start the world again. Now Ayden, the only boy to still ask questions; Zoe, the robot girl all other machines hold dear; and the Dapper Man known only as '41' must discover what happened that made time stop, understand what their true places are in this world, and learn what 'tomorrow' really means.

By chance, she meets Shinichi Chiaki, the top student in the piano program of a prestigious music college in Japan. Nodame is immediately head over heels in love with Chiaki, but he takes much longer to warm up to her unique personality and quirks. The story follows both of their struggles to pursue their musical ambitions and eventual success. This multivolume manga series had been adapted into two television series (a live action and an animated series), as well as two live action movies and three video games. The Nodame character is based on an actual person of the same name. The main character is not shown with large eyes and curvilinear figures that are more conventional features of female characters in anime and manga."

Harry is going to Africa, and has left his pet chimpanzee, Duke, in Ralph's care. Duke has been trained to play catch. Soon Ralph's wife, Alice, returns home from grocery shopping and is horrified to find the chimp in her home. The argument is broken up by the news that the baseball game has been called off. Alice challenges the boys' team to a game, but is missing one player. Duke is added to the girls' team. With the score tied at 0-0 at the bottom of the 9th inning, Duke comes up to bat and hits a home run."

Two years later World War II is in progress and Hans Hein is in the German army. Kid Ryan is taken prisoner in Europe, and the Germans arrange a rematch as a publicity stunt, in a P.O.W. camp. Ryan hasn't been training or eating right, and the fight goes badly for him. In most rounds he is saved only by the bell. At the end of the fight, though, he floors Hein with one punch as his fellow P.O.W.s burst in with guns. Ryan had been playing for time and keeping the Germans cheering loudly while a tunnel into the German arsenal was completed, and the escape plan is a success."

      "\"The Playwright rather enjoys a quiet moment in the local park. It is a good place to mentally sort his ideas, and is often frequented by pretty young ladies. He once saw a pigeon defecate onto a businessman's shoulder. It struck him as absurd that such an event is often considered lucky. Surely the luck lay with passers-by who, statistically, were far less likely to be similarly soiled, at that precise moment. Similarly, the Playwright always derived an almost perverse sense of relief whenever he received news that an old friend had developed prostate cancer. Because statistically, he reasoned, such news significantly reduced the chances of him being similarly afflicted. And to be honest, at his age, his prostate needed all the statistical support he could muster.\" The Playwright: a dark, romantic comedy about the sex life of a celibate, middle-aged man.\""
