      "Translation of: La Cimetière de Cathédrales.",
      "Summary: Professor Wallace de Wolff has found an early nineteenth-century painting of a gothic cathedral in a tropical rainforest, and curiosity leads him to learn of a group of renegade church architects called the Chavesians. The Chavesians had run afoul of the Inquisition, and were exiled to the New World by Queen Isabella, just a few years after Columbus's first voyage. After wandering in the wilderness for awhile, they found a spot in the Amazon jungle and began building cathedrals. Professor De Wolff, still only suspecting much of this, mounts an expedition to the Amazon which includes his son, Sidney, and his assistant, Fay McKee. Meanwhile, on another world, we find that at the end of the previous album Rork had teleported into a situation that has caused a cosmic imbalance, and the aliens decide they have to send him back. Rork lands, almost dead, in the company of the expedition just as they are being attacked by Indians. His presence saves the explorers, and they nurse him back to health. Rork is sensitive to forces coming from the cathedrals, and soon leads them there. An ancient madman tries to chase them away, and Rork identifies him as the evil force he felt. They find another man chained, and he seems to be the good force. Sidney de Wolff dies in a struggle with the madman at the center of a maze. They find another 500-year-old man, named Vosta, and release him from chains. Vosta tells the story of the colony. Rork tells Vosta that they'll meet again in a year, at Rork's house. The company breaks up, and on the way north Rork learns that Sidney's skeleton is inside the body of Vosta. In a wordless epilog Rork gets a message written in the language of the undersea civilization, and starts walking into a desert."

The effort is being coordinated by Deliah Darkthorne, or Low Valley as she now prefers to be called. Low has aged 40 years in the year and a half since teleporting at the end of the Passages album. She is the one who sent the note summoning Rork. Low doesn't understand what the \"event\" is going to be, only that a beam of light will come down from the sky and that it will have transformational powers. Low has placed experiments in the path of the beam, like a mouse, a cactus, and an apple. The beam comes, and things change, but the results aren't very comprehensible. Low takes Rork to another room and shows him her daughter, Sy-Ra, who is floating in the air stuck between worlds as Rork was near the end of \"Passages.\" Low wants Rork to take Sy-Ra to an astrologer to get her fixed up, and Rork agrees. Then Low eats the apple from the beam experiment, and seems to gain a new sense of well-being and extended perceptions. She tells Rork they'll meet again in nine months, at his house."

While Francine's desire for marriage and motherhood suffers a devastating setback, Katchoo embraces a new life in the art world with her own sexy, and highly controversial, paintings. It's only through sheer determination and boundless enthusiasm that Casey manages to bring the two women face to face once more. The result is the most shocking moment in SiP history.\""

He then shoots out all of the crooks' tires, and they are jailed. Dynamite loses the job for falling into their trap. Then the museum director says he got an anonymous telephone call, and the painting is back as a result. Dynamite examines this painting, and it's another fake. The museum director gets physical, Johnny punches him, the original is found and Johnny Dynamite is the hero again."
