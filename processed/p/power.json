Sheltered by a potter the boy grew up with the prophecy of a wandering sage ringing in his ears that he would one day become king. The Sanskrit classic, Kathasaritasagar and Vikrama Charita, from which most of this story is taken, traces the path that made Shalivahana so powerful that an entire era, the Shalivahana Shaka, was named after him.\""
