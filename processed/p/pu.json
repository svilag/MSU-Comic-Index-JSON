      "SUMMARY: Since Ricardo wants to be part of the gang the other boys arrange an initiation. First Ricardo has to carry each of them on his back like a horse. Then he has to let them throw him in the school's rooftop cistern. This is accomplished, but Ricardo can't get himself out of the cistern, sinks to the bottom, and drowns. Carlos pulls him out, and he seems dead, but he's not, quite. The teacher hears the commotion, takes Ricardo to the school doctor, and covers for the boys with the administration. At home Ricardo's mother insists that they move him to a new school. In a private talk with his father Ricardo explains everything, says he deserved his punishment, and wants to stay in the public school. The father understands because he wasn't always rich, and makes up a story to calm his wife. Things go better at school among the boys, and after a few days Ricardo dismisses his chauffeur so he can play baseball in an alley. Since it's a dirty place Ricardo takes his shoes off, and Memín guards them. Some bigger boys come along and want to use the area for their own game, and a fistfight starts. During the confusion a thief picks up Ricardo's shoes."

He leaves his car at work and walks home among regular people, ruminating about poverty. He talks to his mother about his own son living in poverty while he has more money than he can use, and his mother won't hear it. The suggestion that they are unhappy in a house that is too big for them is nonsense to her. Carlos Senior accepts her judgement. School starts again. Memín and Ernesto meet on the first day. Ricardo's mother enrolls him in a private school, and Carlangas has decided to drop out and help his mother, though his mother doesn't know it. When Carlos's mother finds out she is very unhappy and plans to enroll him anyway. When Ricardo tells his father what has happened, he promises to intervene and get his son back into the public school."
