And what if one company decided to initiate a hostile takeover of the other? The Apocalypse plan tells this story. Mr. Abaddon is called to the office to investigate a macabre scene; a board room full of Morningstar employees, all dead in a grisly way. The cause of their deaths is a mystery; toxic gas? Infection? murder? The no-nonsense Abaddon attempts to solve the problem in the most immediate way possible, with the help of an impressionable young woman named Theda. Together they discover a plot to destroy Morningstar and its influence on mankind, a plot masterminded by their rival company, the Grace Corporation. Can they stop this assault in time? Or will the world suffer a hostile takeover of biblical proportions?"

A Japanese Zero crash-lands near the base, and a woman survives, managing to make the men think they've captured secret plans. After the squadron has left to take advantage of the plans, the woman steals a gun and kills the radio operator. The crew of Madam X figures out what has happened, and leaves sick bay in a suicide mission to spring the ambush the Japanese have set up. On page 7, a Japanese radioman says, \"Silver disks",
      "our greatest arsenal gone! Shoot down that plane at any cost!\" The whiz-bomb shown in p. 1 does seem to be disc-shaped, though from the title and cover art we would expect flying saucer UFOs."

      "Summary: Lassie falls out of a boxcar, part of a train speeding through the deep South. Luckily, she's not hurt. Rocky Langford, age 16, is sent to bed without supper in a nearby orphanage, and decides to run away. Rocky soon rescues Lassie from some trigger-happy country folk, and they run away together. Rocky needs a job, but on his first try a sawmill boss knocks him out and steals Lassie. They recover and escape again, and hitch a ride with a friendly family that's relocating. The family helps Rocky get a job on a riverboat heading for New Orleans. In New Orleans, Rocky rescues a boy and gets a job at a boatyard with the boy's grateful guardian. Rocky learns the trade, gets his own sloop by fixing it up, and sails away with Lassie to see the world. A storm comes up, Lassie is washed overboard, and Rocky makes it to Jamaica with his boat half wrecked. Meanwhile Lassie has been rescued by Mr. Lawrence, a plantation owner, and his yacht, and his daughter Gerry. The yacht has come to Jamaica too, and Lassie finds Rocky. Mr. Lawrence offers Rocky a job as timekeeper on his coffee plantation, partly because he wants Gerry to have someone her own age nearby."
