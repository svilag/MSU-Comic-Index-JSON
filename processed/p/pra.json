But adolescence brought questions. Cracks began to appear in the Iron Curtain, and news from the West slowly filtered into the country. Sís learned about beat poetry, rock 'n' roll, blue jeans, and Coca-Cola. He let his hair grow long, secretly read banned books, and joined a rock band. Then came the Prague Spring of 1968, and for a teenager who wanted to see the world and meet the Beatles, this was a magical time. It was short-lived, however, brought to a sudden and brutal end by the Soviet-led invasion. But this brief flowering had provided a glimpse of new possibilities. Creativity could be discouraged but not easily killed."

A rival gang drugs him and throws him into Lake Michigan, but he wakes up. Many of Chicago's criminals are arrested, but Tintin pursues Bobby Smiles out west, where he and Snowy meet cowboys and Indians, strike oil, and get in a train wreck, a prairie fire, and get captured by a lynch mob. Smiles is captured, but then back in Chicago Snowy is kidnapped, and rescued, and a capitalist tries to grind both of them into corned beef, but a strike stops the factory. Tintin is kidnapped again from a banquet celebrating the victory over crime, dumped again in Lake Michigan tied to 400-pound dumbbells, which turn out to be made of wood. 355 suspects are then arrested, and Chicago's underworld is out of business.",

A sa recherche s'acharnent les seigneurs de la guerre chinoise, les bandits mandchous, les troupes alliées et touts les sociétés secrètes chinoises. L'une de ces dernières, les Lanternes rouges, vient de passer contrat avec Corto Maltese pour retrouver le 'train d'or de l'amiral Kolchac'.\"",
