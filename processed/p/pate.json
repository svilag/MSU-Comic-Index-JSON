      "Summary (by Shayna Sherman): Iggy, Tubby and a friend try to shoot a rabbit with their bows and arrows. Then Iggy buys jelly beans and makes a path from the rabbit's hole to their clubhouse, but Lulu follows the path and eats the jelly beans. The boys pretend that the jelly beans were dangerous, make her lie down, and pour a bucket of water over her to \"save her life.\" Lulu overhears them laughing about it, borrows a toy rabbit from Alvin, and puts it in a rowboat out in the water. When the boys shove off on a log to get the rabbit, she pulls the rabbit back to her with a string."
