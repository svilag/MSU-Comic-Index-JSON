      "but always under the roof of his father, a Syrian Pan-Arabist who drags his family along in his pursuit of grandiose dreams for the Arab nation. Riad, delicate and wide-eyed, follows in the trail of his mismatched parents; his mother, a bookish French student, is as modest as his father is flamboyant. Venturing first to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab State and then joining the family tribe in Homs, Syria, they hold fast to the vision of the paradise that always lies just around the corner. And hold they do, though food is scarce, children kill dogs for sport, and with locks banned, the Sattoufs come home one day to discover another family occupying their apartment. The ultimate outsider, Riad, with his flowing blond hair, is called the ultimate insult: Jewish. And in no time at all, his father has come up with yet another grand plan, moving from building a new people to building his own great palace. Brimming with life and dark humor, The Arab of the Future reveals the truth and texture of one eccentric family in an absurd Middle East, and also introduces a master cartoonist in a work destined to stand alongside Maus and Persepolis.\""

And most folks in sleepy Pico Mundo, California, are much more interested in the irresistible pancakes Odd whips up at the local diner. Still, communing with the dead can be useful. Because while some spirits only want a little company, others want justice. When the sad specter of a very frightened boy finds its way to him, Odd vows to root out the evil suddenly infecting the sunny streets of Pico Mundo. But even with his exceptional ability, is Odd any match for a faceless stalker who's always a step ahead and determined to kill again?"

The Cisco Kid changes his clothes, loses the sombrero and the mustache, and puts on a Texas drawl to visit Coyote Creek and investigate. The killer turns out to be Paul Argel, a descendant of Don Miguel Arguello whose land grant from the Spanish king was lost when the United States took California from Mexico. Argel has been taking vengeance on descendants of the settlers who took his family's land."

Nahomi helps them with a problem and is returned home, but in the meantime the Chinese have been blamed for her kidnapping and imprisoned. This insult, and Morodor's continuing refusal to negotiate a pact, leaves the island preparing for war with China.\""

      "Summary (from amazon.com via OCLC): \"Chainmail Bikini is an anthology of comics by and about female gamers! Forty cartoonists have contributed comics about the games they're passionate about, from video games to tabletop role-playing to collectible card games. The comics in Chainmail Bikini explore the real-life impact of entering a fantasy world, and how games can connect us with each other and teach us about ourselves. Alliances are forged, dice get rolled, and dragons get slain! Chainmail Bikini shows that while women are not always the target market for gaming, they are a vital and thoroughly engaged part of it, and are eager to express their personal take as players, makers, and critics of games.\""
