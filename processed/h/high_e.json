      "Summary (by Mary Walker): Luthor is back and a pair of his employees take over the WGBS station to issue a challenge for Superman to meet him at high noon the next day. The first engagement has Superman ending up imprisoned in Luthor's war suit which is programmed to discharge red solar energy whenever its prisoner tries to break free. He tries to contact Jimmy but Jimmy refuses to believe that Superman is imprisoned and the suit reinforces that with a manufactured image of Luthor. It tries to kill Jimmy and then threatens to kill anyone else Superman tries to contact. However Superman has left a message burned in Kryptonese on the wall, which Jimmy deciphers. Next day another strange creature (Trogar) comes to challenge Superman and Superman has to face him looking like and sounding like Luthor. He makes it sound like Luthor is giving Superman a testimonial. This is to much for Luthor's vanity, and soon the battle suit disappears releasing Superman. Trogar turns out to have been Supergirl in disguise. Luthor isn't exactly unhappy because the battle suit has given him a wealth of information about his enemy's physiology which he hopes to use in the next meeting."
