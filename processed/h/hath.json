He finds that the navigational caste has no idea of what is going on in the rest of the ship and little contact except in emergencies. Superman then goes to the main areas of the ship to stop the war. The combatants stop long enough to explain that they have \"divided into nations according to our various races and religions. Differences inevitably lead to conflict!\" and then resume their fighting. He wishes they could be persuaded to work together as they did in building the ship in the first place",
      "that thought gives him an idea. He sends the ship to a suitable, uninhabited planet and they disembark taking their personal belongings and the useful machinery but leaving the weapons behind. A pleased Superman looks on at the aliens who have put violence and hate aside to make a new civilization."
