The breakage stops when Professor Cuthbert Calculus leaves his laboratory for Geneva. Foreign agents seem to be aggressively interested, so Tintin, the Captain, and Snowy fly to Geneva to protect the professor. The spies capture the professor, whose invention is the perfection of a powerful weapon. Tintin and Haddock proceed with the chase and rescue. Although Calculus thinks the plans for the weapon are in his umbrella, which Snowy has been keeping track of, he actually left them on the bedside table at home.",
