Ernesto's father is also angry, blames himself, and says he's going to start drinking again. Both parents are sympathetic once they've heard the whole story, however. Ricardo's mother is frantic and fainting, and his father beats him savagely with his belt, but after an explanation the father is proud of his son. He asks Ricardo not to tell his mother about the beating, and Ricardo agrees. Memín's mother sends him out for milk, and he sees pictures of Carlos and his mother in the newspaper. Carlos has been arrested for murder, and sent to the house of correction. Everyone's first thought is that Ricardo's father might be able to help Carlos, but that seems not to be the case. The boys decide to ask their teacher."

Carlos is put in a straight jacket and whipped by the warden. The warden then gets evidence that Carlos did not kill the guard, but decides to hide the evidence and hold Carlos incommunicado. The prison nurse knows the truth and promises to try and get word to Carlos's mother and friends. Meanwhile Ernesto, Ricardo and Memín come to the institution on visiting day but are denied access to Carlos. Memín sees a laundry chute and jumps in, landing in the prison's basement."
