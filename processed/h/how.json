Justin leads him through the sewers. Evidently Superman also suffers from paranoia and turns on Justin who has found refuge for him in the Superman museum. Justin is saved from the fellow by the real Superman who reveals that the man is an escaped mental patient and the marauders were doctors. His mania is believing he is a reincarnation of Superman. He used advanced technology to make the simulation more believable."
