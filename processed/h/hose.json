      "SUMMARY: Aliens Superman once met as Superboy ask for help in dealing with a threat to their civilization. He agrees and one alien stays to take over Superman's job. The news media name him \"Superman-X.\" Guns turn to dust, kryptonite turns to sandstone, and people begin to think the replacement has surpassed Superman. Superman-X cures hopeless diseases, etc., but doesn't balance his deeds with self-restraint. Lois and Jimmy show Superman-X a news story in which a child with polio and leg braces is killed in the chaos of people trying to get to the \"savior\" at the hospital gates. Superman-X believes it and leaves in a wail of anguish, but the tape was a fake, nobody has died, although the chaos was real. The real Superman returns soon after (summary by Mary Walker)."

Ernestillo says that if his father can see his wife and talk to her when he's drunk, he wants to do it too and talk to his mother. When the boys take the bottle from him, Ernestillo attacks with a hammer and manages to knock himself out. His friends put him in his bed, and return to school. The teacher wants to know what they found, and they say Ernestillo wasn't home. The teacher doesn't believe them, and questions them until he gets the truth. The teacher rushes to the carpentry shop, sees Ernestillo unconscious, and calls an ambulance. The boys wait at the hospital while the teacher looks for Mr. Vargas, the missing father of Ernestillo. The news that his son is in the Red Cross hospital shocks Mr. Vargas, and hearing that Ernestillo was trying to see his mother fills him with shame. In the hospital, Ernestillo recovers. The teacher brings Mr. Vargas to his son, and he begs his son's forgiveness."

Carlos is happy to hear that his mother is still alive, and tells Memín how the warden has whipped him and locked him up for a crime he didn't commit. Memín is noticed and taken to the warden, and the warden gets ready to whip Memín. Memín jumps out the window and hides on the school grounds. He hears two women talking about a ghost sighting around the school, and with a sheet and some stilts he scares the guards enough to make his escape. Meanwhile Elisa, the nurse who knows Carlos is innocent, visits Carlos's mother at the Red Cross hospital and brings her up to date on her son's situation. Carlos's mother brings up the fact that Carlos's father is rich and powerful. Since he has never taken the trouble to even ask about his son, she doesn't want to go to him for help."
