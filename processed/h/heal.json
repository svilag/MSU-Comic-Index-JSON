Kent thinks there must be a pattern which would include his encounter with a space ship the day before in which the ship disappeared. The Thief-Master is from a race in which criminal tendencies had been bred out generations before but he is a genetic atavism. He refuses to consult his family because the shame to them but the Healer thinks of a plan. Superman is unable to stop the next theft, of selenium, and meets the thief only to have him escape but gets a clue to where the thief will strike next: Molybdenum. He sets a successful trap and the thief's entire demeanor changes. The doctor's theory was that the genetic compulsion would end if he were captured against his will."

He is hoping to find something at the site of a UFO landing, but loses his footing and is injured. An alien heals him and explains that his ship is normally invisible. Nyxly repays the alien by knocking him out and taking his ship. The first encounter goes badly for Superman, who leaves and shows up catatonic in the WGBS Building. The alien arrives and begins treatment for a brain short circuit. Nyxly raises havok and Jimmy gets an idea from the alien's comment that Superman would be in a suggestible state until he has healed. They give Superman a remote earpiece and Jimmy directs Superman's assault, followed by Lois, then by Edge. After the battle the alien diagnoses the problem as Kryptonian Sleeping Sickness, against which he was never vaccinated because he left Krypton before it was scheduled."
