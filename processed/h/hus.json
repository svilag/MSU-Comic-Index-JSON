This is hardly surprising, it is known to regularly bestow a hoard of solid gold on their Prince Satrajit. When the gem goes missing, suspicion falls on Krishna. He must prove his innocence, but danger and upheaval threaten at every turn.\""

Or perhaps that goes with having been labelled\n        \"husband\" in the story. For example, in the Stella Norris album <a href=\"/rri/hrri/hurd.htm#stella\"><em>Hurricane,</em></a> there is a husband named Logan who doesn't really figure in the\n        plot. He drives the car. Another husband who never goes into\n        action is that of Erma in the album <a href=\"/rri/erri/erik.htm#jagu\"><em>Erma Jaguar.</em></a> The story\n        turns out to be a dream. But most husbands do at least\n        something: <p><strong>Husbands Cheating or Cheated On.</strong> The album\n        <a href=\"/rri/drri/deadly.htm#dall\"><em>Deadly\n        Dalliance</em></a> has at least four husbands who are cheating\n        or cheated on. In another erotic album, vol. 1 of <em>Grin and\n        Bare It,</em> the husbands are mostly there to be cheated on.\n        In another erotic album <em>Hypocrites,</em> the husbands are\n        only there to be cheated on. In the Horacio Altuna album\n        <a href=\"/rri/nrri/nau.htm#nautyesc\"><em>Naughty\n        Escapades,</em></a> which isn't European like the rest of these\n        but rather Argentine, the same bell is sounded. The story is\n        called \"A Passionate Woman,\" and the husband is there to be\n        cheated on, period. Sigh.</p> <p><strong>Absent Husbands.</strong> In the album <em>Dixie\n        Road</em> Nadine's husband is rarely home, and when he does\n        come home he's just robbed a bank and the police are on his\n        trail. Edith Finkel, in the first album of the series <em>A Jew\n        in Communist Prague,</em> finds out that her husband has been\n        sentenced to ten years in political prison, and in the third\n        album he gets another ten years. In the Georges Pichard album\n        <em>Carmen,</em> things are a little different. Carmen plays\n        fast and loose until her husband, One-Eyed Garcia, gets out of\n        jail. Then, she continues to play fast and loose until Don\n        José, one of her playmates, kills both of them. This one is\n        both absent and a cuckold. But maybe that's normal, because in\n        the album <em>Spanish Fly, v. 4</em> Paul takes up with Dawn,\n        also a fast and loose type, while Dawn's husband El Malaguita\n        is in prison. Another kind of absent husband is the kind who\n        hasn't turned up yet, at least at a level of quality that will\n        suit the prospective bride's dad. This is the case in Alfonso\n        Azpiri's album <a href=\"/rri/wrri/westzwh.htm#azpi\"><em>Wet\n        Dreams.</em></a> The story is titled \"Desert Shadows,\" and the\n        princess gets a magician to conjure up a lover for the interim.\n        Instead of quality, she gets quantity, but at least she's not\n        lonely. On a much less ribald note, the absent husband Rondello\n        in the Willy and Wanda album <a href=\"/rri/trri/tena.htm#mata\"><em>The Tender-Hearted\n        Matador</em></a> actually turns up after many years and takes\n        part in the plot, with an invention that will end the cruelty\n        of bullfighting.</p> <p><strong>Dead and Deserted Husbands.</strong> Chihuahua\n        Pearl's husband Trevor gets killed in the Blueberry album\n        <a href=\"/rri/brri/balla.htm#coff\"><em>Ballad for a\n        Coffin,</em></a> but manages to leave a useful message in one\n        of his boots, which are stolen by his killer. This is the dead\n        but useful husband theme. Moebius gives us another husband in\n        his \"There Is a Prince Charming on Phenixon,\" in the album\n        <em>Exotics,</em> but of course his wife deserts him for a wild\n        pavachus.</p> <p><strong>Troubled Marriages.</strong> In a story called\n        \"Almost Paradise,\" found in the Thorgal album <em>The Sorceress\n        Betrayed,</em> two women decide to make Thorgal their husband.\n        He escapes. The other stories in this album are also about\n        troubled marriage. In another troubled marriage, Sybil\n        Browning's husband is a zombie and attacks her and she has to\n        stab him in the eye with scissors to settle him down. That's in\n        the Dylan Dog story <em>Dawn of the Living Dead.</em> Vicente\n        Segrelles' Mercenary steps into a troubled marriage as well,\n        rescuing a woman for her husband in <em>The Cult of the Sacred\n        Fire.</em> The rescued woman doesn't want to go back to her\n        husband, it seems. Big trouble.</p> <p><strong>Caring and Devoted Husbands.</strong> Then there's\n        the newlywed husband in the story \"Crevice\" (or \"The Crevasse\")\n        in the album <a href=\"/rri/crri/cara.htm#paces\"><em>Carapaces.</em></a> He climbs\n        down into a deep hole and successfully rescues his bride from a\n        sexually-active robot thingy. (The three of them work it out,\n        if you must know.)</p>"
