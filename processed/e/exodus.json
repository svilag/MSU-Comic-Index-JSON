Though Dante believes that the Kraken is only an immortal and troublesome beast, the Church suspects that it is actually Satan himself. In the bunker are a radar station, to watch for the Kraken, and a pulpit, so the exorcist can preach to it. Dante, with some of his men, and the priest's obnoxious assistant are also locked in for the duration. After nine hours of impassioned preaching the Kraken arrives, and the priest seems to die. After hitting the bunker a few times the Kraken leaves. The priest then comes alive again, and is shot by his assistant who thinks the priest is now possessed. The priest, dying once more, says that the assistant is the one who is possessed."
