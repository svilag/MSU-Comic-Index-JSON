      "Chapter 1: \"Night and the Sea\" p. 1-8 -- <strong>Summary:</strong> In January, 1350 A.D., ten men in a\n        boat sinking in a winter storm talk about a crime they've\n        committed. They throw a gourd overboard, sealed with tar and\n        telling of their crime. On the coast near a gallows on which a\n        corpse still hangs, a boy named Gwynplane finds a baby in the\n        snow where its mother has died. <p>Chapter 2: \"The Unfathomable\" p. 9-16 --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> Gwynplane stumbles to the wagon of a\n        man named Ursus, who feeds him and gives the baby milk, then\n        goes out to look for the baby's mother. When Ursus sees that\n        she has the plague and that he has touched her sores, he burns\n        his own hand with a torch to prevent contagion. Returning to\n        his wagon, he discovers that Gwynplane's face is disfigured\n        into a perpetual smile, and that the baby is blind. Ursus names\n        the baby Dea.</p> <p>Chapter 3: \"Eternal Requital\" p. 17-24 --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> Fifteen years later the gourd thrown\n        overboard by the men in the boat is found by soldiers. Ursus,\n        Gwyn and Dea are traveling as actors, doing plays in taverns. A\n        hunted murderer kills himself near their wagon, and Ursus\n        decides not to report it because \"the law always needs a\n        culprit.\" Gwynplane is soon arrested and taken to a tower.</p> <p>Chapter 4: \"The Abyss\" p. 25-32 -- <strong>Summary:</strong>\n        In the tower a man named Hardquanonne is being tortured, and\n        before he dies identifies Gwynplane as Lord Ferdinand\n        Clancharlie, a peer of England. Hardquanonne had performed\n        surgery on Gwynplane's face by order of the King of England,\n        and the men in the boat, faced with death, had broken their\n        oath of silence by writing a deposition and placing it in a\n        gourd. Soldiers return Gwyn's old clothing to Ursus, with the\n        implication that they have killed him, and force Ursus and Dea\n        to leave town.</p> <p>Chapter 5: \"The Fall\" p. 33-40 -- <strong>Summary:</strong>\n        A nobleman has plans to manipulate Gwynplane for his own\n        enrichment, and tells him that Ursus and Dea are dead.\n        Gwynplane stabs him and demands details, and it seems that they\n        have only been chased out of town, but that the clothes given\n        to them were soaked in the blood of a dog who had the plague.\n        Gwynplane lets the man die, and dashes out on a horse to try to\n        find his family.</p> <p>Chapter 6: \"Night and the Sea II\" p. 41-48 --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> Gwyn catches up with Ursus and Dea on\n        the coast, where they are suffering from the plague, and Dea is\n        about to die. Ursus kills himself and is barely aware that\n        Gwynplane has found them. Gwyn picks up the dying Dea and walks\n        into the sea.</p> <p>This summary is from <em>European Comics in English\n        Translation</em> (Jefferson, NC : McFarland &amp; Company, 2002).\n        Used with permission.<br/></p>",
