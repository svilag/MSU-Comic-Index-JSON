      "SUMMARY: On the first day of public school some of the boys are introduced. Carlos Arozamena (Carlangas) has curly hair and is tough and full of mischief. Ricardo Arcaraz (Ricardito) is a stuck-up rich boy with blonde hair and glasses, the son of a diplomat. Guillermo Manquín (Memín) is the only black boy in the class, and his introduction brings derogatory racial remarks from the other boys. Ernesto Vargas (Ernestillo) is very smart, but poor, and comes to school without shoes. Carlos and Ricardo get into a fistfight. Because of his attitude towards his other classmates, the teacher recommends that Ricardo find another school, and Memín cheers. The teacher gives Memín a lecture about equal opportunity. On the way home from school Memín makes friends with Carlos and Ernesto, and warns Carlos that Ricardo's father is planning to complain about the fight. At home, Memín helps his mother with laundry, and Ernesto helps his father finish some furniture. Carlos goes home, where his mother is sleeping because she works the night shift. Ricardo goes home and hears his mother threaten his classmates when she sees his black eye, but Ricardo says he got it playing a game and doesn't complain. Back at school, Ricardo is excluded from the baseball game, and finally asks to play. Because he wants to take charge of the game, the other boys reject him."

      "SUMMARY: Since Ricardo wants to be part of the gang the other boys arrange an initiation. First Ricardo has to carry each of them on his back like a horse. Then he has to let them throw him in the school's rooftop cistern. This is accomplished, but Ricardo can't get himself out of the cistern, sinks to the bottom, and drowns. Carlos pulls him out, and he seems dead, but he's not, quite. The teacher hears the commotion, takes Ricardo to the school doctor, and covers for the boys with the administration. At home Ricardo's mother insists that they move him to a new school. In a private talk with his father Ricardo explains everything, says he deserved his punishment, and wants to stay in the public school. The father understands because he wasn't always rich, and makes up a story to calm his wife. Things go better at school among the boys, and after a few days Ricardo dismisses his chauffeur so he can play baseball in an alley. Since it's a dirty place Ricardo takes his shoes off, and Memín guards them. Some bigger boys come along and want to use the area for their own game, and a fistfight starts. During the confusion a thief picks up Ricardo's shoes."

The teacher rushes to the carpentry shop, sees Ernestillo unconscious, and calls an ambulance. The boys wait at the hospital while the teacher looks for Mr. Vargas, the missing father of Ernestillo. The news that his son is in the Red Cross hospital shocks Mr. Vargas, and hearing that Ernestillo was trying to see his mother fills him with shame. In the hospital, Ernestillo recovers. The teacher brings Mr. Vargas to his son, and he begs his son's forgiveness."

Memín plans to pretend they are musicians. The white boys sing, however badly, and Memín holds it together with his natural rhythm. Meanwhile, Carlos's mother Isabel (\"Chabela\") is in a tough underworld cabaret talking about how she hates her life and how her husband abandoned her when he got rich, though Carlos doesn't know this. Eventually the four friends arrive at the same establishment and find Chabela fighting off a drunk customer. The man hits her and Carlos wades in, knocking him down. The man pulls a gun and tries to shoot Carlos, but Isabel gets between them and is shot. Carlos throws a bottle and apparently kills the man. Isabel is not badly hurt and tells her son to run before the police get there."

Ricardo's mother is frantic and fainting, and his father beats him savagely with his belt, but after an explanation the father is proud of his son. He asks Ricardo not to tell his mother about the beating, and Ricardo agrees. Memín's mother sends him out for milk, and he sees pictures of Carlos and his mother in the newspaper. Carlos has been arrested for murder, and sent to the house of correction. Everyone's first thought is that Ricardo's father might be able to help Carlos, but that seems not to be the case.

      "SUMMARY: Memín explores the reform school where Carlangas is being held until he finds the right solitary confinement cell. Carlos is happy to hear that his mother is still alive, and tells Memín how the warden has whipped him and locked him up for a crime he didn't commit. Memín is noticed and taken to the warden, and the warden gets ready to whip Memín. Memín jumps out the window and hides on the school grounds. He hears two women talking about a ghost sighting around the school, and with a sheet and some stilts he scares the guards enough to make his escape. Meanwhile Elisa, the nurse who knows Carlos is innocent, visits Carlos's mother at the Red Cross hospital and brings her up to date on her son's situation. Carlos's mother brings up the fact that Carlos's father is rich and powerful. Since he has never taken the trouble to even ask about his son, she doesn't want to go to him for help."

      "SUMMARY: It's summer vacation time. Ricardo, Ernestillo, Carlangas and Memín become newsboys. Memín is very good at it, and sells his whole day's supply of papers and magazines in half an hour. He sells the newspapers by shouting that an atomic bomb has landed in the city park, and he sells his \"Doctora Corazon\" magazines to people who look like they're having trouble in their love lives. Carlos and Ernesto have average success, while Ricardo only sells one paper, to a friend of his father's. Memín is soon in trouble with his friends and his mother for lying to sell papers. Memín is grounded and has to help his mother with the laundry until further notice. Ricardo is also in trouble with his mother, who finds it an embarrassment that her son should be hawking papers on the street. Though Ricardo had his father's consent and approval to try the job, his father finally advises that he'd better quit to spare his mother's feelings, especially since she threatens to divorce her husband if he doesn't back her up. The parents of Ernesto and Carlos are happy for the extra money. Carlos's mother says that when he finishes school she's arranged an internship for him. One morning Carlos is running across the street and gets hit by a car."

      "SUMMARY: The driver of the luxury car that has knocked Carlos down in the street takes Carlos out for ice cream. The driver is taken aback to learn Carlos's full name: Carlos Arozamena Martínez. The man overpays Carlos for his lost newspapers, and asks for his address, because he has figured out that Carlos is his son. Meanwhile at home Isabel, the mother of Carlos, deals with a difficult customer, who insults her and takes the sewing she has done without paying. Carlos is outraged, but his mother is resigned to her fate. Then Carlos produces the money he has received from his father, and she accepts this fate also. Carlos Arozamena, Senior, lives in a mansion with his overbearing mother and servants. Memín is still grounded and has to stay home helping his mother all day."

      "SUMMARY: Memín helps his mother in her laundry business during the long summer days. Carlos, Senior, is preoccupied at work. He leaves his car at work and walks home among regular people, ruminating about poverty. He talks to his mother about his own son living in poverty while he has more money than he can use, and his mother won't hear it. The suggestion that they are unhappy in a house that is too big for them is nonsense to her. Carlos Senior accepts her judgement. School starts again. Memín and Ernesto meet on the first day. Ricardo's mother enrolls him in a private school, and Carlangas has decided to drop out and help his mother, though his mother doesn't know it. When Carlos's mother finds out she is very unhappy and plans to enroll him anyway. When Ricardo tells his father what has happened, he promises to intervene and get his son back into the public school."

      "SUMMARY: Isabel, the mother of Carlos, becomes very depressed when she learns that Carlos is missing out on some of the fun with his friends because they're so poor. She pretends to go out all night to a cabaret and come home drunk at dawn. This, she seems to be hoping, will convince Carlos to take his rich father's offer and move into the mansion. Carlos is beside himself to think his mother has gone back to her old profession, and pleads with her to continue doing laundry for people. She says they'll talk about it later, and that for now he should just get out of her way. Carlos goes to play baseball with his friends, and Memín can tell he's upset behind his smile. Memín hits a one-handed home run by imitating the tennis player Pelón Ozuna."
