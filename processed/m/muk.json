He simplified Bengali to make it easy for the common man. He is thus regarded as the father of modern Bengali prose. A gentle crusader, he championed the cause of women. Through his efforts, widow remarriage was legalised, and restrictions were placed on child marriages and bigamy, that were then widely prevalent.\"",
