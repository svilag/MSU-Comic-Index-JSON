      "Summary: Charlie Chicken notices muddy water in the pipes, so Andy opens a pipe and floods the basement. They go outside to find the water main and shut it off, but end up digging all the way around the house before they accidentally break the main pipe. They end up with a moat, so they build a drawbridge. The mailman falls in, then two policemen, and a law librarian finds a law from the year 1591 against moats. By the time research is done and the police return, Andy and Charlie have filled in the moat. The tap water is still muddy."
