      "SUMMARY: Carlos, Ricardo and Ernesto eat in a Chinese restaurant. Memín goes home to get some maracas, figuring that no cabaret will let them in because they are so young. Memín plans to pretend they are musicians. The white boys sing, however badly, and Memín holds it together with his natural rhythm. Meanwhile, Carlos's mother Isabel (\"Chabela\") is in a tough underworld cabaret talking about how she hates her life and how her husband abandoned her when he got rich, though Carlos doesn't know this. Eventually the four friends arrive at the same establishment and find Chabela fighting off a drunk customer. The man hits her and Carlos wades in, knocking him down. The man pulls a gun and tries to shoot Carlos, but Isabel gets between them and is shot. Carlos throws a bottle and apparently kills the man. Isabel is not badly hurt and tells her son to run before the police get there."
