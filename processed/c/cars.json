      "SUMMARY: Memín helps his mother in her laundry business during the long summer days. Carlos, Senior, is preoccupied at work. He leaves his car at work and walks home among regular people, ruminating about poverty. He talks to his mother about his own son living in poverty while he has more money than he can use, and his mother won't hear it. The suggestion that they are unhappy in a house that is too big for them is nonsense to her. Carlos Senior accepts her judgement. School starts again. Memín and Ernesto meet on the first day. Ricardo's mother enrolls him in a private school, and Carlangas has decided to drop out and help his mother, though his mother doesn't know it. When Carlos's mother finds out she is very unhappy and plans to enroll him anyway. When Ricardo tells his father what has happened, he promises to intervene and get his son back into the public school."

      "(Les Aventures de Télé)",

      "Summary: Télé awakes to a power failure with only his/her shadow for company. Télé follows a parade of prehistoric looking, Genet-quoting animal monsters, which joins a group of women truckdrivers and their trucks. A mysterious bodiless shadow is also following the parade. Télé is captured by the kamioneuses (or camioneuses). The truckdrivers are then set upon by a rival gang, the précieuses (or gracieuses), who drive smaller cars. While trying to escape in the confusion with a Proust-quoting monster, Télé is captured by the new gang, but freed by a kiss from the mysterious shadow. Télé flees with the monsters, pursued by both gangs while the city begins to flood. The monsters (quoting Robert Desnos) and Télé make it to a market in the suburbs for a good meal underwater, chewing their literature. The kamioneuses refuel and have a beer. Most of the rest of the story is underwater, with fish going by. Télé is captured by a band of rockeuses (or rockettes), and the animals flee. Both the kamioneuses and the gracieuses see the animals without Télé, and the camioneuses soon attack the rockettes, trying to retrieve Télé. The rockettes escape on their Vespas with a wounded Télé. Télé is left in the care of Garance, the dauphine of the rockettes, who wants to stay home and read comics anyhow. Her pile of comics includes Popeye, Spirou, Tintin and The Spirit. Garance takes Télé on a flying scooter ride, and they visit the Fairy of Domesticity. The fairy hooks Télé up to a futuramama machine and makes predictions. Télé's shadow asks the fairy's shadow about the mysterious shadow. The fairy makes a pay phone ring where the shadow is and she (with the animals quoting Robert Desnos again) is reunited with Télé's shadow. Télé leaves, with the animals quoting Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, to find the shadow's body. The three gangs declare peace. While Télé is still searching, the animals quote Lou Reed &amp; Philip K. Dick. Climbing above the water, Télé finds his/her true love stuck in another dimension, but crashes through to a happy ending.",
