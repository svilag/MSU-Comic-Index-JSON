      "Summary: \"Madam X\" is a grounded bomber upon which \"whiz-bombs\" have been inappropriately mounted. It has been damaged and its crew is injured, and the plane is scheduled to be dismantled. A Japanese Zero crash-lands near the base, and a woman survives, managing to make the men think they've captured secret plans. After the squadron has left to take advantage of the plans, the woman steals a gun and kills the radio operator. The crew of Madam X figures out what has happened, and leaves sick bay in a suicide mission to spring the ambush the Japanese have set up. On page 7, a Japanese radioman says, \"Silver disks",
      "our greatest arsenal gone! Shoot down that plane at any cost!\" The whiz-bomb shown in p. 1 does seem to be disc-shaped, though from the title and cover art we would expect flying saucer UFOs."

The commander doesn't believe them until a message from their communications satellite confirms the story and indicates an invasion in progress.

Burton and Cyb are then ready to call in miners to collect the easily-gathered precious metals pulverized from the asteroid, and the pair also starts figuring what kind of scam to pull with the abandoned fortress."

Justin leads him through the sewers. Evidently Superman also suffers from paranoia and turns on Justin who has found refuge for him in the Superman museum. Justin is saved from the fellow by the real Superman who reveals that the man is an escaped mental patient and the marauders were doctors. His mania is believing he is a reincarnation of Superman.

Mutt's plan is to wait outside to watch and enjoy Jeff's ejection. Jeff enters the home, is mistaken for a waiter, and is put to work serving and sampling the refreshments. When the final guest, a \"Maharaja,\" arrives, Jeff recognizes him as a pickpocket from his old neighborhood. When he prevents the Maharaja from leaving with jewelry stolen from the guests he is rewarded with an invitation to spend the night."
