Pharas takes the assembled company into a spherical ship, apparently manned by people from the undersea civilization, and they journey to where Rork can be seen in suspended animation, caught between worlds. Deliah tries to free him with her powers, which Pharas thinks will ruin everything, when suddenly Adam Niels hits the spherical ship with an arrow to its fatal point, and blows it up. Adam has figured out that it was this ship that earlier destroyed his laboratory. Adam reveals that it was he who hired Raffington Stevens. In the confusion, Rork and Deliah have teleported together, but Pharas says they probably didn't arrive anywhere together."
