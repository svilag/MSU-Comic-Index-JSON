In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong. Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other superpowered person he can find, aside from his own sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible powers on both sides, spurred onward by the memory of betrayal and desperate longings, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge, but who will be left alive at the end?\"",

The fictional character, Marisol Rios De La Luz, is a Columbia University Earth and Environmental Sciences Undergraduate student living with her parents Flor De La Luz Rojas and Oscar 'Chango' Rios Velez in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She takes a semester of study abroad in collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico. There she explores the caves of Puerto Rico: Ventana, La Cueva del Indio, Las Cuevas de Camuy, La Cueva del Viento and the caves at the Julio Enrique Monagas National Park. At each of these caves she finds five similar sized crystals. Atabex, the Taino mother goddess, appears before Marisol once the crystals are united and summons her sons Y√∫cahu and Juracan. Y√∫cahu, God of the seas and the mountains gives Marisol her superhuman strength. Juracan, god of the hurricanes gives her the power of flight and control of the wind.\""

On a visit to Arkville, FBI agents spot Phil Clay, who fits a witness description. Phil has just come into some money, and owns a black 1957 Cadillac like a witness has seen leaving the scene of a stolen car dropoff. In the car the FBI finds a map telling them where the next heist will be. This time the watchman at the construction site is a young G-Man, a former college football player, who tackles Phil Clay and brings an end to the crime spree.",

On a visit to Arkville, FBI agents spot Phil Clay, who fits a witness description. Phil has just come into some money, and owns a black 1957 Cadillac like a witness has seen leaving the scene of a stolen car dropoff. In the car the FBI finds a map telling them where the next heist will be. This time the watchman at the construction site is a young G-Man, a former college football player, who tackles Phil Clay and brings an end to the crime spree.",
