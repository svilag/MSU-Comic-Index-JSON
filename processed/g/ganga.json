But, the dauntless daughter of the mountain god was not to be easily subdued as her waters darted about uncontrollably. Only Shiva could tame her by entangling her in the coils of his hair. When her waters could finally wriggle their way out, they were calmer and purer. They turned arid wastes alive and filled up the oceans. Since those ancient times when King Bhagiratha sought her help, Ganga, whether roaring or placid, dancing or sombre, continues to enchant one and all with her incomparable beauty.\"",

      "\"The East End is barely part of London anymore. Isolationist gangs have violently ripped the neighborhood from its place in society, creating their own insular world. Now, after a bloody year of turf wars, the East End's ruling families return home victorious to resume their reign. And risen above them all is one man: Julius. Unlike the crime lords who came before him, Julius rules the streets with a just and fair law. The people love him; the other families fear him and his power. Now they are considering what once would have been unthinkable: complete dissolution of the families' organizations in favor of a single leader. But not everyone is ready for this new world order. As the ides of March draw near, even some of his top lieutenants question Julius' growing power. Antony Johnston and Brett Weldele recreate Shakespeare's classic political thriller with a hard modern edge, bringing new relevance and poignancy to Julius Caesar.\""

A rival gang drugs him and throws him into Lake Michigan, but he wakes up. Many of Chicago's criminals are arrested, but Tintin pursues Bobby Smiles out west, where he and Snowy meet cowboys and Indians, strike oil, and get in a train wreck, a prairie fire, and get captured by a lynch mob. Smiles is captured, but then back in Chicago Snowy is kidnapped, and rescued, and a capitalist tries to grind both of them into corned beef, but a strike stops the factory. Tintin is kidnapped again from a banquet celebrating the victory over crime, dumped again in Lake Michigan tied to 400-pound dumbbells, which turn out to be made of wood. 355 suspects are then arrested, and Chicago's underworld is out of business.",
