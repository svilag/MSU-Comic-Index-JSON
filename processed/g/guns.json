      "Summary: Dante is in the sewers with some new recruits and one of them has dunked the radio. An alert comes through, about a terrorist and a hostage in their area, but the message is garbled. Proceeding to the scene with the recruit and a sergeant, they find a man and woman struggling over a gun. The woman cries for help, so they kill the man. Then the radio starts to work and they realize she's the terrorist, and she has a gun still. With the recruit and the sergeant both shot, she runs out of bullets. The woman taunts Lieutenant Dante, saying he would never shoot a woman in cold blood because it's against the rules. The sergeant uses the last of his strength to lift his gun and shoot her himself, and then dies not knowing that there are two bullets in her body."

Memín plans to pretend they are musicians. The white boys sing, however badly, and Memín holds it together with his natural rhythm. Meanwhile, Carlos's mother Isabel (\"Chabela\") is in a tough underworld cabaret talking about how she hates her life and how her husband abandoned her when he got rich, though Carlos doesn't know this. Eventually the four friends arrive at the same establishment and find Chabela fighting off a drunk customer. The man hits her and Carlos wades in, knocking him down. The man pulls a gun and tries to shoot Carlos, but Isabel gets between them and is shot. Carlos throws a bottle and apparently kills the man. Isabel is not badly hurt and tells her son to run before the police get there."

The news media name him \"Superman-X.\" Guns turn to dust, kryptonite turns to sandstone, and people begin to think the replacement has surpassed Superman. Superman-X cures hopeless diseases, etc., but doesn't balance his deeds with self-restraint. Lois and Jimmy show Superman-X a news story in which a child with polio and leg braces is killed in the chaos of people trying to get to the \"savior\" at the hospital gates. Superman-X believes it and leaves in a wail of anguish, but the tape was a fake, nobody has died, although the chaos was real. The real Superman returns soon after (summary by Mary Walker)."
