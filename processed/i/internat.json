      "Summary: Eighteen year old Prince Zwanna enrolls at BASU (Black American State University), where his brother King Siafa has sent him for his royal education. At registration he meets a classmate named Stefani Stoul, and in class the next day he asks her out. Another classmate hears Zwanna's definition of ethics in class (\"we kill our enemies\"), and reports Zwanna to Wilma Femse, chief of the Focal Spy Company (FSC). FCS is apparently part of an international conspiracy that King Siafra warned him Zwanna about. The other three agents of FSC are called the Black Widows, named Georgina Shrubs, Rhoda Rayban, and Jamie Carter. All four are white transvestites. That night Zwanna's \"Zulu sense\" wakes him and he rushes out to find three white thugs beating up a black couple. One thung has a Hitler moustache, one has a swastika tattoo, and one wears a Confederate flag. All three are skinheads. Zwanna shouts the word \"Zhaab!\" and is transformed into a near-naked warrior with a spear and necklaces. The thugs are quickly killed. In the office of the Black Widows, the four transvestites make plans to catch Zwanna, focusing on his radicalism and his sexuality. In an office closet they have the corpse of W.R. Tolbert of Liberia. Soon Zwanna is kidnapped and chained for their admiration, and Stefani is brought out and threatened. This is too much, Stefani faints, and Zwanna shouts \"Zhaab!\" This gives him the power to rip the chains from the concrete and kill three of the transvestites. He then shouts \"Chaka!\" which enables him to leap ahead of the final transvestite and kill him. Zwanna picks up the unconscious Stefani and heads for home."
