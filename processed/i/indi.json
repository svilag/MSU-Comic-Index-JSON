      "Summary: The story opens at \"Terre Brulée,\" the ranch of Giddap Joe. An Indian boy named Wa Wa is hauling water for the horses when he comes upon White Deer, a girl who brings a warning. The white man in the blue mountains must leave, she says, or he will be killed. There are only 15 days until winter snow is expected. Joe takes the warning seriously, and rides up into the mountains to look for the man. The man turns out to be Bruce Altman, an old friend. It starts to snow early, and the two are stuck in Altman's cabin for the winter. Altman's story is that he was out hunting with his young son Tom, six years earlier, when Tom saw an Indian, panicked, and killed her. She was out picking berries. Bruce told Tom never to admit he did it, and Bruce took the blame for the crime himself. The incident led to the killing of two other white families by the Indians. The people of the town, Lone Pine, were about to lynch Bruce as the cause of the Indian attacks, so he went into hiding. Unbeknownst to Bruce, Tom has stood up in church and told the truth within the past year, to clear his father's name. The brother of the dead girl is still hunting Bruce, but Giddap intercedes and explains the situation to the brother. Bruce goes home."
