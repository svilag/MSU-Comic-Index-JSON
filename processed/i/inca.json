      "Book One: \"The Dark Incal.\" <p>Chapter One: \"Crimson Circle Nights\" 8 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> On the planet Ter 21, Private\n        investigator John Difool is beaten and dropped toward the acid\n        lake by thugs who want information he claims he doesn't have.\n        The police rescue him, and he tells a story of being hired by a\n        rich woman as a bodyguard, and being chased by a wolf-headed\n        man named Kill Wolfhead. The police are also not satisfied with\n        his story, but they let him go.</p> <p>Chapter Two: \"The Incal's Ball\" 10 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> The secret that Difool has been\n        guarding is that, before his beating, he met a group of mutants\n        in the ventilation shafts. One of them gave him something\n        called 'The Incal,' before it apparently died of wounds\n        inflicted by pursuers. Inside its false body was an alien,\n        which Difool recognized as a 'Berg.' Difool had hidden the\n        Incal inside his pet/companion, Deepo (a concrete bird), and\n        when he gets home Deepo has attracted a crowd and is preaching\n        and doing miracles. A Berg commando unit arrives and shoots up\n        the crowd looking for the Incal, then a force of armed mutants\n        joins the fray, and then the police. In the confusion, Difool\n        gets away but is kidnapped by the President's hunchbacks (a\n        personal security team).</p> <p>Chapter Three: \"His High Ophidity\" 11 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> Taken before the President, Difool is\n        interrogated about the Incal but denies everything. He has\n        swallowed it, though, and he begins to glow and vomits on the\n        President's nice new body. The Incal gives him super powers. He\n        escapes by stealing the President's aircar. Examining the\n        Incal, he finds that it is alive. The Incal tells him that he\n        needs to know himself better, and be transformed, and puts him\n        on a funeral train for Techno City.</p> <p>Chapter Four: \"Techno Technique\" 6 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> John and Deepo find themselves\n        heading for a machine that disassembles bodies for use in\n        manufacturing robots and androids. Techno-City is controlled by\n        something called the Dark Incal. John tries to escape, and gets\n        the attention of the Techno-Pope, who plans a personal\n        vivisection of John to remove the Bright Incal within him.</p> <p>Chapter Five: \"The Meta-Baron\" 8 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> The Amok Queen, who seems to rule an\n        area below the city, kidnaps the son of the Meta-Baron. To get\n        his son back the bounty hunter must get John Difool for her\n        within 24 hours. A riot begins in the city, and the Meta-Baron\n        barely escapes in his ship, heading for Techno City and\n        wondering what's so important about John Difool.</p>",
      "Book Two: \"The Bright Incal.\" <p>Chapter One: \"Ove Tenebrae\" 7 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> Ceremonial extraction of the Incal\n        from John Difool is about to begin, but first the Techno-Pope\n        releases a 'shadow egg,' a large dark construct that will \"seed\n        the universe with darkness.\" Deepo is watching the ceremony\n        from the rafters, trying to figure out what they're doing with\n        his master.</p> <p>Chapter Two: \"Panic in the Internal Exterior\" 8 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> Just as the dismemberment is about to\n        begin, Deepo dives through the black ovoid that the Techno-Pope\n        has suspended over his head like a halo. The ovoid, called a\n        'psycho-abdomen,' soon reforms, but in the confusion John and\n        Deepo make it through a trap door into something called the\n        'Internal Exterior,' where they are soon threatened by a\n        monster called the Cardioclaw. Meanwhile both Berg commandos\n        and the Meta-Baron are approaching Techno City, and the Baron\n        kills the Bergs.</p> <p>Chapter Three: \"Animah!\" 8 p. -- <strong>Summary:</strong>\n        By putting his faith in the Bright Incal, John is able to\n        defeat the Cardioclaw and get the Dark Incal. With that, Techno\n        City is destroyed. The president's advisors tell him to call\n        the Emperoratrix for help. A woman visits John Difool in the\n        wreckage of Techno City, and he gives her the Dark Incal\n        without question. She says her name is Animah, and she leaves.\n        In the snow outside, the Meta-Baron catches up with John and\n        Deepo.</p> <p>Chapter Four: \"Neuraztenik Class Struggle\" 8 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> The Amok Queen is leading a\n        rebellion, and the Wolfhead is her general. The rebels attack\n        the presidential palace with a nucleo-tactical weapon and seem\n        to be winning. The president, who hasn't been taking it\n        seriously, gets a call from the Emperoratrix. The Emperoratrix\n        is a double person, both male and female. The Meta-Baron\n        approaches with his apparently dead prisoner.</p> <p>Chapter Five: \"The Emperoratrix\" 7 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> The Emperoratrix tells the President\n        that the most serious problem is not the rebellion, nor an\n        impending Berg invasion, but rather destroying the dark\n        egg-shaped artifact that seems to be disturbing their sun. The\n        Emperoratrix launches a space fleet to counter the Berg fleet.\n        The Amok Queen refuses to return the Meta-Baron's son, whose\n        name is Sunmoon, and orders them both killed and John Difool's\n        body opened immediately. All three captives suddenly display\n        superpowers and overpower the guards. The rebels led by\n        Wolfhead break into the palace, but the President is dead.\n        Actually the President has been re-cloned as a killing machine\n        called the Necroprobe (with built in and constantly narrated\n        holo-broadcasting on all human entertainment channels) and\n        counterattacks.</p> <p>Chapter Six: \"The Acid Lake\" 7 p. --\n        <strong>Summary:</strong> Wolfhead returns to the Amok Queen\n        alone, and with all her guards defeated she says they must join\n        forces with Sunmoon, the Meta-Baron, and John Difool. Difool\n        reveals that he has given the Dark Incal to Animah, whom\n        Sunmoon thinks of as his mother, and whom the Baron thinks of\n        as the Queen of the Rats. It turns out that below the acid lake\n        there is a world from which both Animah and the Amok Queen (who\n        calls herself Tanatah) have come. The two women are sisters,\n        and former guardians of the two Incals. The way below the acid\n        lake is blocked, and the five humans and Deepo are caught in a\n        whirlpool while trying to cross the lake to another entrance\n        using the Baron's skiff as a raft.</p>"
