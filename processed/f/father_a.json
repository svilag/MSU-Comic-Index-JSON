      "SUMMARY: Since Ricardo wants to be part of the gang the other boys arrange an initiation. First Ricardo has to carry each of them on his back like a horse. Then he has to let them throw him in the school's rooftop cistern. This is accomplished, but Ricardo can't get himself out of the cistern, sinks to the bottom, and drowns. Carlos pulls him out, and he seems dead, but he's not, quite. The teacher hears the commotion, takes Ricardo to the school doctor, and covers for the boys with the administration. At home Ricardo's mother insists that they move him to a new school. In a private talk with his father Ricardo explains everything, says he deserved his punishment, and wants to stay in the public school. The father understands because he wasn't always rich, and makes up a story to calm his wife. Things go better at school among the boys, and after a few days Ricardo dismisses his chauffeur so he can play baseball in an alley. Since it's a dirty place Ricardo takes his shoes off, and Memín guards them. Some bigger boys come along and want to use the area for their own game, and a fistfight starts. During the confusion a thief picks up Ricardo's shoes."

      "SUMMARY: Memín, Ricardito and Carlangas find their friend in the carpentry shop, drinking liquor. Ernestillo says that if his father can see his wife and talk to her when he's drunk, he wants to do it too and talk to his mother. When the boys take the bottle from him, Ernestillo attacks with a hammer and manages to knock himself out. His friends put him in his bed, and return to school. The teacher wants to know what they found, and they say Ernestillo wasn't home. The teacher doesn't believe them, and questions them until he gets the truth. The teacher rushes to the carpentry shop, sees Ernestillo unconscious, and calls an ambulance. The boys wait at the hospital while the teacher looks for Mr. Vargas, the missing father of Ernestillo. The news that his son is in the Red Cross hospital shocks Mr. Vargas, and hearing that Ernestillo was trying to see his mother fills him with shame. In the hospital, Ernestillo recovers. The teacher brings Mr. Vargas to his son, and he begs his son's forgiveness."

Ricardo's mother is frantic and fainting, and his father beats him savagely with his belt, but after an explanation the father is proud of his son. He asks Ricardo not to tell his mother about the beating, and Ricardo agrees. Memín's mother sends him out for milk, and he sees pictures of Carlos and his mother in the newspaper. Carlos has been arrested for murder, and sent to the house of correction. Everyone's first thought is that Ricardo's father might be able to help Carlos, but that seems not to be the case.

Memín is noticed and taken to the warden, and the warden gets ready to whip Memín. Memín jumps out the window and hides on the school grounds. He hears two women talking about a ghost sighting around the school, and with a sheet and some stilts he scares the guards enough to make his escape. Meanwhile Elisa, the nurse who knows Carlos is innocent, visits Carlos's mother at the Red Cross hospital and brings her up to date on her son's situation. Carlos's mother brings up the fact that Carlos's father is rich and powerful. Since he has never taken the trouble to even ask about his son, she doesn't want to go to him for help."
