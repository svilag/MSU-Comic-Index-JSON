It turns out the Mustang pilot didn't need help, but when Johnny returns to his flight it's surrounded by German fighters. Johnny's unexpected return saves the day, and back at the base the new pilot reports. His name is Lt. Tom Talon, and like Cloud he is Native American. The other pilots observe the meeting of the two men with these comments: \"Look at the dead-pan way those two are looking at each other!\" \"Just like Indians! Never showing what they feel!\" We learn that as boys the two men played together on the reservation, and that Talon's brother died during one of their games and Cloud is unfairly blamed for the death. Talon has sworn to kill Cloud, though the other men don't know this. On the next mission Johnny Cloud makes Talon his wingman, demoting a disapproving Tex to no. 3. Talon saves Cloud's life after first putting it in jeopardy. The next day Cloud saves Talon's life nearly at the expense of his own, and lands barely alive in enemy territory. Talon lands to pick him up, and they make it to safety even though being fired upon by a German tank. Talon considers the fact that Cloud saved his life to be payment of the debt for his brother's life.",
