      "Summary (by Mary Walker): Lana Lang reports on mysterious sightings of a 'super-Batman'. Kent calls Bruce Wayne and leaves a message with Alfred that he has a good reason for what he is doing and will explain later. He recalls how Lana had some Pan-pipes which her father found with a statue of the god and how he experienced an excruciating pain when she blew on them. Later he looks in the mirror and finds he has grown horns. He realizes that the syrinx, or pipes, may be the cure but he has to find them because they have been stolen. To hide what has happened he adopts Batman's cowl and cape in place of his own cape. He uses the horns to capture the superstitious thief before the spell dissipates taking the horns with them. He tells Bruce about the episode and asks, \"How do you ever manage to scare anyone in that get-up of yours?\""

She pretends to go out all night to a cabaret and come home drunk at dawn. This, she seems to be hoping, will convince Carlos to take his rich father's offer and move into the mansion. Carlos is beside himself to think his mother has gone back to her old profession, and pleads with her to continue doing laundry for people. She says they'll talk about it later, and that for now he should just get out of her way. Carlos goes to play baseball with his friends, and Memín can tell he's upset behind his smile. Memín hits a one-handed home run by imitating the tennis player Pelón Ozuna."
