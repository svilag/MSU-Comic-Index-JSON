      "Summary: \"Madam X\" is a grounded bomber upon which \"whiz-bombs\" have been inappropriately mounted. It has been damaged and its crew is injured, and the plane is scheduled to be dismantled. A Japanese Zero crash-lands near the base, and a woman survives, managing to make the men think they've captured secret plans. After the squadron has left to take advantage of the plans, the woman steals a gun and kills the radio operator. The crew of Madam X figures out what has happened, and leaves sick bay in a suicide mission to spring the ambush the Japanese have set up. On page 7, a Japanese radioman says, \"Silver disks",
      "our greatest arsenal gone! Shoot down that plane at any cost!\" The whiz-bomb shown in p. 1 does seem to be disc-shaped, though from the title and cover art we would expect flying saucer UFOs."
