      "<strong>Note:</strong> The \"vagabond of limbo\" is a\n        well-favored young man named Axle Munshine, into whose dreams\n        has come the vision of fair Chimeer. With a goading perpetually\n        thirteen-year-old companion named Musky, he searches the\n        universe. A four-page introduction to this first\n        English-language album is helpful, because this is the sixth in\n        the original series. In the introduction the authors are quoted\n        as trying to \"dream up something very difficult.\" The series\n        won the prize for best science fiction series at the 1976\n        Angoulême festival. The English-language series title changes\n        to \"The Vagabond in Limbo\" for the second volume. <p><strong>Summary:</strong>While a beautiful actress is trying\n        to get into a part for a movie called \"Vagabond from Nimbus,\"\n        Axle visits a clairvoyant to ask where he might find the\n        mysterious Chimeer about whom he has dreamed. From her remote\n        asteroid the clairvoyant hears the actress in Hollywood\n        rehearsing her lines, and gives Axel the coordinates for Earth.\n        Over the protestations of Axle's young companion, Musky, she\n        also gives Axle a large caterpiller with the power to rearrange\n        reality. At that moment on Earth the role seems to click for\n        the actress, and her agent is amazed at how intelligent she\n        starts to sound. The change happens to other actors and\n        actresses all around Hollywood, however, and soon chaos reigns\n        with stranglers really strangling, Nazis rounding up people,\n        bands of Indians on motorcycles, stuntmen on kamikaze missions,\n        etc. The police are confused. When Axle finally finds Chimeer\n        she is about to be burned at the stake as a witch by a Cardinal\n        in a Nazi concentration camp designed by Leonardo Da Vinci. At\n        that moment Musky shoots the caterpillar, and reality returns..\n        or at least enough so that the police can operate again. The\n        actress stomps off to complain to her agent, and Axle and Musky\n        leave the planet.</p> <p>This summary is from <em>European Comics in English\n        Translation</em> (Jefferson, NC : McFarland &amp; Company, 2002).\n        Used with permission.<br/></p>",
