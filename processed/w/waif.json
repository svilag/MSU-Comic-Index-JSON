Superman-X cures hopeless diseases, etc., but doesn't balance his deeds with self-restraint. Lois and Jimmy show Superman-X a news story in which a child with polio and leg braces is killed in the chaos of people trying to get to the \"savior\" at the hospital gates. Superman-X believes it and leaves in a wail of anguish, but the tape was a fake, nobody has died, although the chaos was real. The real Superman returns soon after (summary by Mary Walker)."
