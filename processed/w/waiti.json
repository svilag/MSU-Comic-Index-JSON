On a business road trip, his car breaks down, stranding him in a small town in rural Virginia. While at first he greets his circumstances with irritation, Charles slowly begins to realize that this accident may be the luckiest thing that ever happened to him. His disappearance may just be his chance at a new life, and the down-to-earth waitress from the local diner might just be his second opportunity for love. That is, if the past doesn't catch up with him first.\""
