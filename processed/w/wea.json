Carlos is happy to hear that his mother is still alive, and tells Mem√≠n how the warden has whipped him and locked him up for a crime he didn't commit. Mem√≠n is noticed and taken to the warden, and the warden gets ready to whip Mem√≠n. Mem√≠n jumps out the window and hides on the school grounds. He hears two women talking about a ghost sighting around the school, and with a sheet and some stilts he scares the guards enough to make his escape. Meanwhile Elisa, the nurse who knows Carlos is innocent, visits Carlos's mother at the Red Cross hospital and brings her up to date on her son's situation. Carlos's mother brings up the fact that Carlos's father is rich and powerful. Since he has never taken the trouble to even ask about his son, she doesn't want to go to him for help."

Captain Marvel checks it out, and indeed the apes are occupying human villages and using human weapons. Captain Marvel assumes a human trainer is behind this behavior. The apes can't talk. Monkeys and chimpanzees are also acting this way. Captain Marvel next finds a band of white men with firebrands chasing black people, and the men tell him how to find their boss, whom they've never seen. The \"ape mastermind\" catches and gags Billy Batson, and explains himself. He was born extra intelligent, and knows both human speech and ape language. He plans to conquer Africa, then the world, because \"humans have ruled Earth too long!\" The ape is about to throw Billy into a fire, when the human henchmen arrive, curious to see what their boss is like. One of them says, \"We aren't low enough to turn traitor to the human race by helping apes! It was all a mistake!\" The ape is put in a cage to be studied by scientists for the rest of his \"natural life.\"",

The spies capture the professor, whose invention is the perfection of a powerful weapon. Tintin and Haddock proceed with the chase and rescue. Although Calculus thinks the plans for the weapon are in his umbrella, which Snowy has been keeping track of, he actually left them on the bedside table at home.",

While this exchange is happening, the jellyfish attacks and Burton chases it away with the sonic cannon in his ship. Cyb refuses to sell the cannon, so Burton shoots him and soon has collected a big price for the cannon. They leave towing Marietta, their pet jellyfish, while Burton repairs the hole in Cyb's chest."

Superman then goes to the main areas of the ship to stop the war. The combatants stop long enough to explain that they have \"divided into nations according to our various races and religions. Differences inevitably lead to conflict!\" and then resume their fighting. He wishes they could be persuaded to work together as they did in building the ship in the first place",
