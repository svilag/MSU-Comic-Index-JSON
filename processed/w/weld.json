      "\"The East End is barely part of London anymore. Isolationist gangs have violently ripped the neighborhood from its place in society, creating their own insular world. Now, after a bloody year of turf wars, the East End's ruling families return home victorious to resume their reign. And risen above them all is one man: Julius. Unlike the crime lords who came before him, Julius rules the streets with a just and fair law. The people love him; the other families fear him and his power. Now they are considering what once would have been unthinkable: complete dissolution of the families' organizations in favor of a single leader. But not everyone is ready for this new world order. As the ides of March draw near, even some of his top lieutenants question Julius' growing power. Antony Johnston and Brett Weldele recreate Shakespeare's classic political thriller with a hard modern edge, bringing new relevance and poignancy to Julius Caesar.\""

      "Summary: The janitor at Radio City Music Hall has been killed by a sandbag, and the word \"Rosebug\" has been written by the victim in the spilled sand. Schlomo, Orsoni Wells, and the FBI arrive to investigate. The FBI says there's a Negro acting as a German spy in the show, and Wells rewrites the script to trick him into revealing himself during the performance. His name is Greenwood, and he gets away. Looking for him, Schlomo finds a nest of German spies and hears that they're heading for Washington. With Wells and the FBI, Schlomo heads for Washington. In Washington they apprehend Greenwood pretending to be an ambassador from England. Schlomo doesn't think the case is over, and indeed soon notices that Orsoni Wells' shoes make a footprint that spells \"Rosebug.\" The Wells in Washington is a fake Wells sent by the Germans to bomb a meeting in the Pentagon. Schlomo disarms the bomb and rescues the real Wells.",
