      "\"No rogue regime ever needed its evildoing professionally reframed more urgently than Greater Berzerkistan, whose president-for-life Trff Bmzklfrpz (pronounced \"Ptklm\") needs to spin a recent round of ethnic cleansing. Fortunately, the pariah state (and its fifty-hole golf course, built overnight by Kurds and Jews) borders Iran, a fact that K Street uberlobbyist Duke is retained to parlay into a major U.S. arms package. Across town, the crumbling of the newspaper industry crushes Rick Redfern's hope of continuing employment. After thirty-five years at the Washington Post, he is ejected into the blogosphere, where his prose now battles it out with that of 1,186,783,465 rivals, including Roland Hedley, who takes the art of Twittering to a new self-reverential low.\""

Ricardo's mother is frantic and fainting, and his father beats him savagely with his belt, but after an explanation the father is proud of his son. He asks Ricardo not to tell his mother about the beating, and Ricardo agrees. Memín's mother sends him out for milk, and he sees pictures of Carlos and his mother in the newspaper. Carlos has been arrested for murder, and sent to the house of correction. Everyone's first thought is that Ricardo's father might be able to help Carlos, but that seems not to be the case. The boys decide to ask their teacher."

Gladstone's manifesto debunks the notion that The Media is an external force, outside of our control, since we've begun directly constructing, filtering, and responding to what we watch and read. With fascinating digressions, sobering anecdotes, and brave analytical wit, The Influencing Machine equips us to be smart, savvy, informed consumers and shapers of the media. It shows that we have met the media and it is us."
