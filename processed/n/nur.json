Carlos is happy to hear that his mother is still alive, and tells Memín how the warden has whipped him and locked him up for a crime he didn't commit. Memín is noticed and taken to the warden, and the warden gets ready to whip Memín. Memín jumps out the window and hides on the school grounds. He hears two women talking about a ghost sighting around the school, and with a sheet and some stilts he scares the guards enough to make his escape. Meanwhile Elisa, the nurse who knows Carlos is innocent, visits Carlos's mother at the Red Cross hospital and brings her up to date on her son's situation. Carlos's mother brings up the fact that Carlos's father is rich and powerful. Since he has never taken the trouble to even ask about his son, she doesn't want to go to him for help."

      "Summary: Roy Rogers and Pat Brady have assembled a \"gyro-glider\" in sheriff Bob Marsh's back yard. The sheriff gets a call from the Indian hospital saying Dr. John Cloud Mountain has been injured in a Jeep accident and wants to see Roy. Dr. Cloud Mountain is a \"brilliant Navajo surgeon\" and a crusader for \"white man medicine,\" who has detractors among the Indian medicine men. His nurse and fiancée, Marie Bluebell, seems to have been kidnapped while he was unconscious at the site of the wreck. The doctor suspects it was all the work of her father Yellow Singer and her half-brother Short Bull, both bitter opponents of the hospital. Roy and John figure out that Marie Bluebell is being held in a small remote canyon, and to avoid shooting Roy sneaks in for a landing at night in his new and silent man-powered helicopter-glider. Roy and Marie sneak out as far as where Trigger is waiting, but then the shooting starts and Roy tells Marie to ride away. She doesn't go far, and comes back in the nick of time to save Roy. John and Marie get married, and Yellow Singer gives the bride away as a condition for not going to jail."
