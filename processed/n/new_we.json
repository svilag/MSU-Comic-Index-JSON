While fending off their increasing hostility and the danger of treacherous pirates, Parquagh must struggle to ensure the safe passage of the ship and its prisoner, as well as a dangerous and mysterious cargo.\""

No one even imagined that the garden would turn into a killing field. The British Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, in a bid to teach 'a moral lesson to the Punjab,' ordered his soldiers to open fire at the unarmed crowd of men, women and children.

It leads him to meme theory, as he wonders if there could be a cold science behind the conversion of people into suicide bombers. And ultimately, it brings him to Ahmed, a Gitmo prisoner who promises the answers to all of Aaron's questions. To those ends, he'll take Aaron from Guantanamo Bay to the jihadist camps in Pakistan, back to Ground Zero in New York City. But where do Ahmed's real loyalties lie? Where did that loyalty spring from? To answer that, Aaron will have to reexamine everything he believes about love and loyalty, and stare down one of the most compelling questions of the 21st Century.\""

When a team led by Iceberg arrives on the North Polar Icecap to investigate an old Russian ice station, it doesn't take long for COBRA to set an ambush and capture the Joes! Meanwhile, Firefly and Crystal Ball unleash an insidious operation to infiltrate a G.I. Joe stronghold located in the heart of New York and shut the JOEs' secret weapon down. It's up to Mainframe and Joe Colton to put an end to COBRA's scheme. But the clock's ticking. Can they shut down the assault in time to help out Iceberg and his team?"

      "Summary (from publisher via SkyRiver): \"A mesmerizing, heartbreaking graphic novel of immigrant life on New York's Lower East Side at the turn of the twentieth century, as seen through the eyes of twin sisters whose lives take radically and tragically different paths. For six-year-old Esther and Fanya, the teeming streets of New York's Lower East Side circa 1910 are both a fascinating playground and a place where life's lessons are learned quickly and often cruelly. In drawings that capture both the tumult and the telling details of that street life, Unterzakhn (Yiddish for 'Underthings') tells the story of these sisters: as wide-eyed little girls, as teenagers, and, finally, as adults battling for their own piece of the 'golden land,' where the difference between just barely surviving and triumphantly succeeding involves, for each of them, painful decisions that will have unavoidably tragic repercussions.\""
