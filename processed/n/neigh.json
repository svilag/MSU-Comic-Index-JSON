Bill is excited that he'll finally see Indians. Bill sneaks out, overhears the Indians' plan, and gives a warning in time for the settlers to drive off an attack. They give him the nickname \"French-Bill\" for that. The Indians come back, and Bill distinguishes himself by killing some with his Uncle Joe's rifle. Nelanton is gone for a long time again, and so Joe and Bill ride out to find him. The Indians have Nelanton tied to a pole, but the sentry is sleeping so Joe and Bill effect a rescue.
