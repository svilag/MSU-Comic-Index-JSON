      "\"During the seventeenth century, the Mughals reigned supreme over Northern and Central India. In the Deccan endless battles went on between other kings like Adil Shah of Bijapur and chiefs like the Nawab of Janjira. The common man suffered at the hands of the officers as well as the marauding Khans and Sardars. Even the zeal of such fighting races as the Rajputs had been suppressed by centuries of slavery under Mughal rule. Many of them had become mere puppets, holdings posts of honour under their royal masters. At such a period was Shivaji born. He was the son of an incredibly brave father and a wise and loving mother. These two and a teacher named Dadoji were the moulding influences on Shivaji's character. The boy showed an uncommon understanding of the happenings around him. The wicked deeds of the ruling class made him angry and restless. The flame of freedom burnt in the little boy's heart. He collected around him a band of devoted followers and as they grew up they swore to throw off the yoke of alien rule. How Shivaji carried out his ambitious plans with success, is told in pictures in the following pages.\"",

It tells the stories of a group of heroes who stand for different classes of people daring to struggle against the corruption and oppression of the times. Altogether there are 105 men and three women among the notable characters in the Liangshan band. These stories take place at the end of the Northern Song period and describe vividly the people's lives of love and hate, ties of friendship, loyalty and enmity, etc. This book relives the most stirring chapters in the novel which have become the subject of numerous dramas and films, and are the most popular episodes in Chinese fiction. They include Lin Chong killing the unworthy chief of Liangshan Marsh, Wu Song slaying a tiger with his bare fists and avenging injustices, and Song Jiang's attacks on the Zhu Family Village.\"",

Harry is going to Africa, and has left his pet chimpanzee, Duke, in Ralph's care. Duke has been trained to play catch. Soon Ralph's wife, Alice, returns home from grocery shopping and is horrified to find the chimp in her home. The argument is broken up by the news that the baseball game has been called off. Alice challenges the boys' team to a game, but is missing one player. Duke is added to the girls' team. With the score tied at 0-0 at the bottom of the 9th inning, Duke comes up to bat and hits a home run."

      "The Founders\n        Memorial Library at Northern Illinois University holds a\n        collection of 125 comic book titles. The comic book collection\n        is based around a large donation of a single collector. Much of\n        the comic book collection dates from the 1970s, although there\n        are earlier and later issues. The library does not hold a\n        significant number of Golden Age or Silver Age comics. A\n        portion of the collection is minimally processed, and there are\n        gaps in runs of titles. The Library is currently working on a\n        searchable database of holdings. In the meantime, the\n        collection grows, chiefly through donations. Recent\n        acquisitions include full runs of Strangers in Paradise and\n        Cerebus in trade paperback format, and autographed copies of a\n        short Scary Godmother run in single issues. The Library also\n        has a small but growing cache of original comic art.
