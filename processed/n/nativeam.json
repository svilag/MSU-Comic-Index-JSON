      "Summary: Johnny leaves his patrol when Tex spots an unknown Mustang about to be ambushed by a Messerschmitt. It turns out the Mustang pilot didn't need help, but when Johnny returns to his flight it's surrounded by German fighters. Johnny's unexpected return saves the day, and back at the base the new pilot reports. His name is Lt. Tom Talon, and like Cloud he is Native American. The other pilots observe the meeting of the two men with these comments: \"Look at the dead-pan way those two are looking at each other!\" \"Just like Indians! Never showing what they feel!\" We learn that as boys the two men played together on the reservation, and that Talon's brother died during one of their games and Cloud is unfairly blamed for the death. Talon has sworn to kill Cloud, though the other men don't know this. On the next mission Johnny Cloud makes Talon his wingman, demoting a disapproving Tex to no. 3. Talon saves Cloud's life after first putting it in jeopardy. The next day Cloud saves Talon's life nearly at the expense of his own, and lands barely alive in enemy territory. Talon lands to pick him up, and they make it to safety even though being fired upon by a German tank. Talon considers the fact that Cloud saved his life to be payment of the debt for his brother's life.",

The natives call themselves a super race, The Deros, and they call their underground caves Lemuria. The Deros say that one day the world will fear them. Their leader is Donnerwetter, one of Hitler's most infamous generals. The Nazi general has been grooming an underground army to take over the world. The Blackhawks can't let that happen. With a little ingenuity and a little lighter fuel they lock the super race in a chamber and let the Earth's core set them ablaze. The Blackhawks escape in the nick of time."

Captain Marvel checks it out, and indeed the apes are occupying human villages and using human weapons. Captain Marvel assumes a human trainer is behind this behavior. The apes can't talk. Monkeys and chimpanzees are also acting this way. Captain Marvel next finds a band of white men with firebrands chasing black people, and the men tell him how to find their boss, whom they've never seen. The \"ape mastermind\" catches and gags Billy Batson, and explains himself. He was born extra intelligent, and knows both human speech and ape language. He plans to conquer Africa, then the world, because \"humans have ruled Earth too long!\" The ape is about to throw Billy into a fire, when the human henchmen arrive, curious to see what their boss is like. One of them says, \"We aren't low enough to turn traitor to the human race by helping apes! It was all a mistake!\" The ape is put in a cage to be studied by scientists for the rest of his \"natural life.\"",

A mysterious bird, a falcon, saves Captain America from the Exiles. It is revealed that the falcon is controlled by a Black man. Captain America disguises the Red Skull's body using clay to make new facial features, and thanks the man, remarking that he sounds \"more Harlem than Haitian.\" The man indeed grew up in Harlem, raising pigeons on a rooftop, but on a vacation in Rio de Janeiro he found a different bird, a falcon named Redwing. A newspaper job advertisement brought him to the Isle of the Exiles, but the Exiles don't actually hire people, they enslave them. The two men talk about strategy for defeating the Exiles, and Captain America convinces the man (still nameless) to put on a green mask and costume to \"serve as a symbol to the natives.\" \"The Falcon\" is born. Back in New York, the Skull enjoys impersonating Captain America, though Modok, at A.I.M headquarters, is looking for a way to make the Cosmic Cube power down."

In the story <a href=\"/rri/grri/grau.htm#rork\">\"The\n        Graveyard of Cathedrals,\"</a> in the album of the same title by\n        Andreas, a group of explorers in the Amazon is attacked by\n        Indians. In the title story of the album <a href=\"/rri/rrri/refl.htm#azpi\"><em>Reflections,</em></a> by Alfonso\n        Azpiri, a conquistador in Peru is captured by Indians and\n        treated to revenge for an earlier crime. In the Jerome\n        Charyn/François Boucq album <a href=\"/rri/brri/billy.htm#bbkgb\"><em>Billy Budd, KGB,</em></a> an\n        undercover Billy gets a job with Indians in New York working on\n        the construction of a skyscraper. In \"John and Mary, Mary and\n        John,\" the second story in the album <a href=\"/rri/trri/three_n.htm#women\"><em>Three Women at the\n        Frontier</em></a> by Paolo Eleuteri-Serpieri and R. Ambrosio,\n        John and Mary talk about marriage and captivity among the\n        Indians. In \"The Emerald Lake,\" a story written by Pierre\n        Christin and drawn by Jean Giraud, a Brazilian man searches for\n        a lake told about by Indians. This is the final story in the\n        album <a href=\"/rri/brri/bluea.htm#secr\"><em>Blueberry's\n        Secret.</em></a> In Giraud's Lt. Blueberry album <a href=\"/rri/irri/irish.htm#blue\"><em>The Iron Horse,</em></a> Blueberry is sent to negotiate with the Indians during trouble\n        with the laying of the first transcontinental railway. In the\n        continuation album, <em>Steelfingers,</em> the Indians have the\n        construction camp under siege. The next album, <a href=\"/rri/grri/gen.htm#mane\"><em>General Golden Mane,</em></a> resolves the situation with massacres and an appearance by\n        Sitting Bull. In the Marshall Blueberry album <a href=\"/rri/lrri/lost_c.htm#dutc\"><em>The Lost Dutchman's\n        Mine,</em></a> the lost mine is in a mesa considered sacred by\n        Apaches. The backup story in this album, \"King of the Buffalo,\"\n        is an early Jean Giraud story about an Indian protecting his\n        people from buffalo hunters. In the Giraud Blueberry album <a href=\"/rri/brri/brod.htm#nose\"><em>Broken Nose,</em></a> Michael Blueberry has become a \"war chief\" of the Apaches, and\n        is caught by the army. In the sequel, <a href=\"/rri/lrri/long_b.htm#march\"><em>The Long March,</em></a> the\n        Apaches (mostly now held in a prison camp by the army) help\n        Blueberry escape, and the end of this story arc in <a href=\"/rri/grri/ghost_s.htm#tribe\"><em>The Ghost Tribe</em></a> has\n        most of the Apache tribe escaping to Mexico. The comedy album <a href=\"/rri/mrri/magician.htm#trea\"><em>Magnesia's\n        Treasure,</em></a> by Greg, has a generic South American Indian\n        tribe called the Kilikilibambas. Hergé's album <a href=\"/rri/trri/tintin_c.htm#amer\"><em>Tintin in America</em></a> spends time with Blackfoot Indians. In <a href=\"/rri/prri/prisnr_a.htm#sun\"><em>Prisoners of the Sun,</em></a> Tintin goes to Peru and is captured by Incas. In Hermann's\n        first Jeremiah album, <a href=\"/rri/trri/talks.htm#blood\"><em>Talons of Blood,</em></a> raiders are selling people to the Indians for slaves. In Régis\n        Loisel's version of Peter Pan, in the album <em>Neverland</em> ,\n        the pirate captain captures Indians to use as crocodile food.\n        In the adventure story parody by Milo Manara, <a href=\"/rri/hrri/h.htm#berg\"><em>HP and Giuseppe Bergman</em>,</a> there are South American Indians at every turn. Another Milo\n        Manara album, <em>Click 3,</em> involves being chased by\n        Brazilian Indians. <em>El Gaucho,</em> also by Manara, tells\n        the story of a Scottish man who has apparently lived with\n        Argentine Indians most of his life. Manara's <a href=\"/rri/irri/india.htm#milo\"><em>Indian Summer</em></a> is about\n        relations between Indians and colonists in New England. <em>The\n        Paper Man,</em> also by Manara, features several Indian\n        characters including a young woman named White Rabbit who wears\n        no pants, and a man called the Contrary Indian, who does\n        everything backwards. In Max's version of Peter Pan, titled <a href=\"/rri/prri/peter_pd.htm#pank\"><em>Peter Pank</em>,</a> the Indians are Charles Manson-worshipping hippies. The Lucky\n        Luke album <a href=\"/rri/arri/ap.htm#cany\"><em>Apache\n        Canyon,</em></a> by Morris and Goscinny, involves Indians\n        fighting the cavalry, the Indian captivity of a colonel's son,\n        and Indians as tourist attractions. Illegal sales of guns to\n        the Apaches spark the plot in the Lucky Luke album <a href=\"/rri/crri/cal.htm#janeluke\"><em>Calamity Jane,</em></a> and\n        Lucky Luke and company are captured by Indians in <a href=\"/rri/srri/stag.htm#coach\"><em>The Stage Coach.</em></a> There\n        is an Indian caretaker named Sam on the ranch in Lucky Luke's <a href=\"/rri/trri/tena.htm#foot\"><em>The Tenderfoot,</em></a> and in <em>Western Circus</em> a band of Indians become an\n        attraction in a Wild West Show formed by the merger of a rodeo\n        and a circus. Somewhere between Dutch Guiana and Bahia (Brazil)\n        an Indian channels a telepathic message for Corto Maltese in\n        part 2 of Hugo Pratt's album <a href=\"/rri/brri/brazil.htm#eagle\"><em>The Brazilian Eagle.</em></a> In the story \"Mushroom Heads,\" in the Hugo Pratt album <a href=\"/rri/brri/ban.htm#conga\"><em>Banana Conga,</em></a> Corto\n        Maltese dreams a treacherous Jivaro Indian. The Corto Maltese\n        story \"A Tale of Two Grandfathers\" (in the album <em>Voodoo for\n        the President</em> ) involves a man's quest to find his\n        grandson, who is being raised by Indians in South America. In\n        the Godard and Ribera album <a href=\"/rri/wrri/what_im.htm#real\"><em>What is Reality,\n        Papa?</em></a> there are bands of Indians on motorcycles adding\n        to the general chaos. In <a href=\"/rri/arri/asterixa.htm#cross\"><em>Asterix and the Great\n        Crossing</em></a> (by Goscinny and Uderzo) Asterix and Obelix\n        accidentally travel to the New World, but have to leave when an\n        Indian chief wants Obelix to marry his daughter. <a href=\"/rri/arri/asterixb.htm#amer\"><em>Asterix Conquers\n        America</em></a> is a children's book in which Obelix again\n        interacts with an Indian chief's daughter. The Willy\n        Vandersteen album <a href=\"/rri/frri/fooda.htm#gold\"><em>A\n        Fool's Gold</em></a> has Lambik buying a treasure map from an\n        Indian at a traveling Wild West show, and with his friends\n        Willy and Wanda is soon in California among the Indians\n        searching for gold. And in <a href=\"/rri/hrri/hor.htm#hord\"><em>Hord,</em></a> an album by Jab Jab\n        Whammo and J.D. Morvan, a society of Native Americans has grown\n        up within the virtual reality of a computer game, and they plan\n        to take over the game."
