The magical child whose ominous coming has been foretold for the past hundred years has now been born and has grown up to claim his dreadful heritage. His promised aeon of unending terror can commence, the world can now be ended starting with North London, and there is no League, extraordinary or otherwise, that now stands in his way. The bitter, intractable war of attrition in Q'umar crawls bloodily to its fifth year, while away in Kashmir, a Sikh terrorist with a now-nuclear-armed submarine wages a holy war against Islam that might push the whole world into atomic holocaust, and in a London mental institution there's a patient who insists that she has all the answers."

      "\"It was a time of dark and light,\" begins the story. It is set in the year 1258, with the Mongol army poised for plunder outside Baghdad. In desperation, keepers of the great libraries forge 99 magical stones, the Noor Stones, into which they pour the wisdom of the ages. The stones are then lost, until now, as young people around the world start finding them and discovering that each stone gives its bearer a superpower: one of the 99 attributes of God, as revealed in the Qur'an. The 99 is the first international comic series based on Islamic archetypes.\""
