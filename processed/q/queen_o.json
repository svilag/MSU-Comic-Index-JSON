      "Summary (from SkyRiver): Hatter follows the Glow from London to the battlefields of America's Civil War in search of the Princess who must some day be Queen. The America that Hatter encounters is a sprawling, wounded, boiling landscape of innocence and energy run amok. The war is tearing the country apart, yet Hatter must maintain his sanity in this maelstrom of holy rollers, child healers, prophetic snake handlers, deranged outlaws, and passionate southern belles. As Hatter searches he learns he is not the only Wonderland presence that has found its way to the Promised Land. Queen Redd's black imagination is fueling the Civil War and threatening our world with her evil!"

Jackson has discovered a race of giant intelligent ants, and introduces Captain Marvel Jr. to Zoggo, the prime minister of Ant City, and to Illia, the queen. A criminal ant called Zatan is causing trouble by committing robberies. \"Within the unhuman ant form exists an evil, cruel mind!\" Zatan plans to take over Ant City and be king, then conquer the rest of the world. Zatan gets away from Captain Marvel Jr. using his \"great jumping ability, like all insects.\" He's an \"ant Hitler!\" Before an ant-human peace treaty can even be proposed, Zatan kidnaps Queen Illia and demands to be made king as his ransom. Once he has the crown, the soldiers obey him and are soon attacking a human village. Freddy Freeman and the queen end up tied together, and when Freddy is able to say \"Captain Marvel\" they escape and uncrown Zatan. Zatan goes to jail.",

The necklace broke and Queen Chellana, who was wearing it, insisted that it be repaired. Would anyone string the stones, even for a big reward, and risk death? And if there was such a man, whould the king honour his promise and give the reward to his heirs?
