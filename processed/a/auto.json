      "Summary (from SkyRiver): Cartoonist Lucy Knisley got an opportunity that most only dream of: a travel-expenses-paid trip to Europe and Scandinavia, thanks to a book tour. An Age of License is Knisley's comics travel memoir recounting her adventures. It's punctuated by whimsical visual devices; peppered with the cats she meets along the way; and, of course, features her hallmark drawings and descriptions of food that will make your mouth water. But it's not all kittens and raclette crêpes: Knisley's experiences are colored by anxieties, introspective self-inquiries, and quotidian revelations about traveling alone in unfamiliar countries, and about her life and career."

Riad, delicate and wide-eyed, follows in the trail of his mismatched parents; his mother, a bookish French student, is as modest as his father is flamboyant. Venturing first to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab State and then joining the family tribe in Homs, Syria, they hold fast to the vision of the paradise that always lies just around the corner. And hold they do, though food is scarce, children kill dogs for sport, and with locks banned, the Sattoufs come home one day to discover another family occupying their apartment. The ultimate outsider, Riad, with his flowing blond hair, is called the ultimate insult: Jewish. And in no time at all, his father has come up with yet another grand plan, moving from building a new people to building his own great palace. Brimming with life and dark humor, The Arab of the Future reveals the truth and texture of one eccentric family in an absurd Middle East, and also introduces a master cartoonist in a work destined to stand alongside Maus and Persepolis.\""

Issu d'un milieu pauvre, féru de politique et obsédé par le panarabisme, Abdel-Razak Sattouf élève son fils Riad dans le culte des grands dictateurs arabes, symboles de modernité et de puissance virile. En 1984, la famille déménage en Syrie et rejoint le berceau des Sattouf, un petit village près de Homs. Malmené par ses cousins (il est blond, cela n'aide pas..), le jeune Riad découvre la rudesse de la vie paysanne traditionnelle. Son père, lui, n'a qu'une idée en tête : que son fils Riad aille à l'école syrienne et devienne un Arabe moderne et éduqué, un Arabe du futur."

      "Summary (from OCLC): This extraordinary graphic novel is a powerful denunciation of sexual violence against women. As seen through the eyes of a twelve-year-old girl named Una, it takes place in northern England in 1977, as the Yorkshire Ripper, a serial killer of prostitutes, is on the loose and creating panic among the townspeople. As the police struggle in their clumsy attempts to find the killer, and the headlines in the local paper become more urgent, a once self-confident Una teaches herself to \"lower her gaze\" in order to deflect attention from boys. After she is \"slut-shamed\" at school for having birth control pills, Una herself is the subject of violent acts for which she comes to blame herself. But as the police finally catch up and identify the killer, Una grapples with the patterns of behavior that led her to believe she was to blame. Becoming Unbecoming combines various styles, press clippings, photo-based illustrations, and splashes of color to convey Una's sense of confusion and rage, as well as sobering statistics on sexual violence against women.",

Exploring the anguish of immigration and the lasting effects that displacement has on a child and her family, Bui documents the story of her family's daring escape after the fall of South Vietnam in the 1970s, and the difficulties they faced building new lives for themselves. At the heart of Bui's story is a universal struggle: While adjusting to life as a first-time mother, she ultimately discovers what it means to be a parent, the endless sacrifices, the unnoticed gestures, and the depths of unspoken love. Despite how impossible it seems to take on the simultaneous roles of both parent and child, Bui pushes through. With haunting, poetic writing and breathtaking art, she examines the strength of family, the importance of identity, and the meaning of home."

      "Summary (from OCLC): In her first memoir, Roz Chast brings her signature wit to the topic of aging parents. Spanning the last several years of their lives and told through a mixture of cartoons, family photos, documents, and a narrative as rife with laughs as it is with tears, Chast's memoir is both comfort and comic relief for anyone experiencing the life-altering loss of elderly parents. When it came to her elderly mother and father, Roz held to the practices of denial, avoidance, and distraction. But when Elizabeth Chast climbed a ladder to locate an old souvenir from the \"crazy closet\"",
      "with predictable results",
      "the tools that had served Roz well through her parents' seventies, eighties, and into their early nineties could no longer be deployed. While the particulars are Chast-ian in their idiosyncrasies",
      "an anxious father who had relied heavily on his wife for stability as he slipped into dementia and a former assistant principal mother whose overbearing personality had sidelined Roz for decades",
      "the themes are universal: adult children accepting a parental role; aging and unstable parents leaving a family home for an institution; dealing with uncomfortable physical intimacies; managing logistics; and hiring strangers to provide the most personal care."

Walking home one evening, he was jumped and viciously beaten within an inch of his life. His recovery process was arduous, hampered by the imagined antics of the villains he was writing for television including the Joker, Harley Quinn and the Penguin. But despite how bleak his circumstances were, or perhaps because of it, Dini also always imagined the Batman at his side, chivvying him along during his darkest moments. This is a Batman story like no other: the harrowing and eloquent autobiographical tale of writer Paul Dini's courageous struggle to overcome a desperate situation."

In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes, but every new cure ended in disappointment. Angry at his brother for 'abandoning' him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, the author learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a window into his interior life, as well as reliving his grandfathers' experiences in both World Wars through flashbacks. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, this graphic autobiography is also a moving depiction of one family's intricate history."

Remaining in Canada, he became involved with a terrorist organization bent on overthrowing the Communist Yugoslav government and attacking its supporters in North America. Then in 1977, while his family was still in Yugoslavia, Peter was killed in an accidental explosion while building a bomb. Through exquisite and haunting black-and-white art, Nina Bunjevac documents the immediate circumstances surrounding her father's death and provides a sweeping account of the former Yugoslavia under fascism and communism, telling an unforgettable true story of how the scars of history are borne by family and nation alike.\""

Meet Alison's father, a historic preservation expert and obsessive restorer of the family's Victorian house, a third-generation funeral home director, a high school English teacher, an icily distant parent, and a closeted homosexual who, as it turns out, is involved with male students and a family babysitter. Through narrative that is alternately heartbreaking and fiercely funny, we are drawn into a daughter's complex yearning for her father. And yet, apart from assigned stints dusting caskets at the family-owned 'fun home,' as Alison and her brothers call it, the relationship achieves its most intimate expression through the shared code of books. When Alison comes out as homosexual herself in late adolescence, the denouement is swift, graphic, and redemptive."

At the time, it was the only thing e felt comfortable with strangers knowing about em. Now, Gender Queer is here. Maia's intensely cathartic autobiography charts eir journey of self-identity, which includes the mortification and confusion of adolescent crushes, grappling with how to come out to family and society, bonding with friends over erotic gay fanfiction, and facing the trauma and fundamental violation of pap smears. Started as a way to explain to eir family what it means to be nonbinary and asexual, Gender Queer is more than a personal story: it is a useful and touching guide on gender identity, what it means and how to think about it, for advocates, friends, and humans everywhere.\""

And the crackdown that ultimately forces her family and others to flee for their lives includes homosexuals among its targets",

When Kristen Radtke was in college, the sudden death of a beloved uncle and, not long after his funeral, the sight of an abandoned mining town marked the beginning moments of a lifelong fascination with ruins and with people and places left behind. Over time, this fascination deepened until it triggered a journey around the world in search of ruined places. Now, in this genre-smashing graphic memoir, she leads us through deserted towns in the American Midwest, Italian villas, islands in the Philippines, New York City, and the delicate passageways of the human heart. At once narrative and factual, historical and personal, Radtke's stunning illustrations and piercing text never shy away from the big questions: why are we here, and what will we leave behind?\""

As Janet and Stan confront the jagged terrain of cancer, then navigate the twilight of terminal illness, two portraits emerge: of a woman who faced her cancer the same way she lived her life, with guts and charm; and of the man who held her close and shared her struggle.",

      "Summary (from publisher via OCLC): En octobre 2012, Bernard Valgaeren entame dans son petit village de Sanary sur Mer, une grève de la faim. Cette action désespérée est dictée par un problème qu'il essaye de régler avec l'administration française et le gouvernement du Burkina Faso. En 2003, Bernard travaille sur l'installation d'un orphelinat dans ce pays africain. Il y rencontre Jean-Eudes, petit garçon de sept ans qui au bout de quelques jours sur le chantier, s'approche de lui et lui demande tout simplement de devenir son papa. Pour Bernard, c'est avant tout, bien sur, une surprise et un choix délicat, mais après de nombreuses interrogations et réflexions et une multitude de péripéties (comme le fait d'apprendre que cet enfant possède une mère, toujours vivante, à quelques centaines de kilomètres de là), Bernard se décide à accéder à cette demande. Mais cette grève de la faim n'est pas entreprise pour dénoncer d'éventuelles lenteurs administratives du coté français ou africain mais pour une toute autre raison qui prend un sens très particulier: le refus de cette adoption sous le pré texte très simple que Bernard n'est pas en couple (et l'adoption dans une famille monoparentale n'est pas très appréciée) et que monsieur Bernard Valgaeren 'tente de cacher la mauvaise vie qu'il mène en France'. En d'autres termes, Bernard est homosexuel et ça, ce n'est pas apprécié du tout.",

      "Summary (from OCLC): Im zweiten Band seiner Autobiographischen Schriften beschließt der Schüler Thomas Bernhard, sich seinem Leben zu entziehen. Statt weiterhin die Schule zu besuchen, findet er im Keller einer Lebensmittelhandlung am Rande der verhassten Stadt, im Wohngetto der Besitzlosen und Kriminellen, eine Lehrstelle. Er lernt dort die von der Gesellschaft Ausgestoßenen kennen, denen er sich nahe fühlt, und er lernt erstmals, was es heißt, angenommen zu werden und 'nützlich' zu sein. Der Alltag im 'Keller' erweist sich als heilsam, die 'Vorhölle' wird zur 'Zuflucht', bis eine schwere Krankheit Bernhards Lehre ein jähes Ende setzt. Für den erzählerischen Ton des Autors findet Lukas Kummer hier eine aufgelockerte Bildsprache. Er begleitet Thomas Bernhard mit präzisem Strich durch diese vielleicht hellste Zeit seiner Jugend und leuchtet den 'Keller' kongenial aus."

Fertility problems were followed by miscarriages, and her eventual successful pregnancy plagued by health issues, up to a dramatic, near-death experience during labor and delivery. This moving, hilarious, and surprisingly informative memoir not only follows Lucy's personal transition into motherhood but also illustrates the history and science of reproductive health from all angles, including curious facts and inspiring (and notorious) figures in medicine and midwifery. Whether you've got kids, want them, or want nothing to do with them, there's something in this graphic memoir to open your mind and heart.\"",

But as Philippe becomes more acquainted with the group and its charismatic leader, masks begin to slip, and he finds himself plunged into the centre of an unexpected drama. With his life turned upside-down, he seeks comfort in reading, and manages to find his bearings again when he discovers the old-fashioned adventure series of Jack Bowmore.

      "Summary (from publisher's website): \"Nicolas is a moving debut work by Quebecois cartoonist Pascal Girard. The book is presented as a series of short autobiographical vignettes that take place after the childhood death of his younger brother, Nicolas, who passed away in 1990. Each episode taken from Girard's childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood offers a glimpse into his multifaceted and ongoing process of reckoning, as he struggles to reconcile the magnitude of this tragedy with the minutiae of his daily experience of loss. Deftly sidestepping the cloying sentimentality and abject self-pity that might seem endemic to such a personal project, Girard treats his subject with a spare line and a refreshingly matter-of-fact tone that prove to be all the more moving in their honest simplicity. Ultimately, Nicolas unfolds as a delicate portrait of the many faces of mourning, identified with surprising humor and pathos by an artist who knows them intimately.\""

Brown captures the perpetual guilt and loneliness of adolescence perfectly. What makes the book especially interesting is the method Chester employs in juxtaposing his adult life with his teenage years - his adult \"self\" time-travels back to his pubescent life and not only narrates the story, but actually becomes a visible little \"fairy\" type of creature and interacts with the story in a comforting comic voice.\""

In spare and elegant detail, they share memories of her middle class childhood touching on cultural practices, the education system, Saddam Hussein's state control, and her family's history as Orthodox Christians in the Arab world. Poppies of Iraq is intimate and wide-ranging; the story of how one can become separated from one's homeland and still feel intimately connected yet ultimately estranged. Signs of an oppressive regime permeate a seemingly normal life: magazines arrive edited by customs; the color red is banned after the execution of General Kassim; Baathist militiamen are publicly hanged and school kids are bussed past them to bear witness. As conditions in Mosul worsen over her childhood, Brigitte's father is always hopeful that life in Iraq will return to being secular and prosperous. The family eventually feels compelled to move to Paris, however, where Brigitte finds herself not quite belonging to either culture. Trondheim brings to life Findakly's memories to create a poignant family portrait that covers loss, tragedy, love, and the loneliness of exile.\""

Hart creatively portrays the solace he discovers in nature, philosophy, great works of literature, and art across all mediums in this expressively honest and loving tribute to his baby girl.

Im Alter von 27 Jahren versucht sie, gemeinsam mit ihrem Freund über die Ostsee schwimmend das Land zu verlassen. Nach zwei Tagen und Nächten in ständiger Angst, zu ertrinken oder entdeckt zu werden, werden beide schließlich von einer Grenzpatrouille aufgegriffen; zwei Jahre Haft folgen. Dann wird Carmen Rohrbach ausgewiesen. Bald darauf bereist die studierte Biologie als Dokumentarfilmerin und Autorin die Galapagosinseln und schließlich die ganze Welt. Der Comic-Künstler und Illustrator Daniel Haas sowie Simon Traschinsky, der die Buchvorlage Rohrbachs für diesen Comic adaptierte, legen ein beeindruckendes Debüt vor, das den Freiheitsdrang der Autorin, ihre Gefühlswelt und Liebe zur Natur auf ganz besondere Weise erlebbar macht.",

Now, their story has become a way of understanding her story: a journey from the innocence of youth to the chaos of adulthood, through her mother's mastectomy, her father's mistress, her husband's music, and the endlessly evolving definition of family. As cancer strikes three different lives, some relationships crumble while others emerge even stronger, and this sarcastic child of the '70s finally finds a goddess she can believe in.\""

Experience the forces that shaped an American icon, and America itself, in this gripping tale of courage, country, loyalty, and love. George Takei has captured hearts and minds worldwide with his captivating stage presence and outspoken commitment to equal rights. But long before he braved new frontiers in Star Trek, he woke up as a four-year-old boy to find his own birth country at war with his father's and their entire family forced from their home into an uncertain future. In 1942, at the order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, every person of Japanese descent on the west coast was rounded up and shipped to one of ten 'relocation centers', hundreds or thousands of miles from home, where they would be held for years under armed guard. They Called Us Enemy is Takei's firsthand account of those years behind barbed wire, the joys and terrors of growing up under legalized racism, his mother's hard choices, his father's faith in democracy, and the way those experiences planted the seeds for his astonishing future. What is American? Who gets to decide? When the world is against you, what can one person do?\""

      "Summary (from SkyRiver): Through annotated illustrations, journals, maps, and dreamscapes, Peter Sís shows what life was like for a child who loved to draw, proudly wore the red scarf of a Young Pioneer, stood guard at the giant statue of Stalin, and believed whatever he was told to believe. But adolescence brought questions. Cracks began to appear in the Iron Curtain, and news from the West slowly filtered into the country. Sís learned about beat poetry, rock 'n' roll, blue jeans, and Coca-Cola. He let his hair grow long, secretly read banned books, and joined a rock band. Then came the Prague Spring of 1968, and for a teenager who wanted to see the world and meet the Beatles, this was a magical time. It was short-lived, however, brought to a sudden and brutal end by the Soviet-led invasion. But this brief flowering had provided a glimpse of new possibilities. Creativity could be discouraged but not easily killed."

      "Summary (from SkyRiver): In Beirut in September 1982, while Israeli soldiers secured the area, a Christian militia entered the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila and massacred hundreds, if not thousands, of Palestinians. Ari Folman was one of those Israeli soldiers, but for more than twenty years he remembered nothing of that night. Then came a friend's disturbing dream and with it Folman's need to excavate the truth of the war in Lebanon and answer the crucial question: What was he doing during the hours of slaughter at Sabra and Shatila? Stunningly original in form, Waltz with Bashir follows Folman's journey deep into the darkness of Beirut. Drawing on the stories of other soldiers and his own returning fragments of memory, Folman painfully and candidly pieces together the war and his place in it: the senselessness of the soldiers' orders; the fear that pervades every moment; the casual bloodshed of civilians, culminating in the massacres themselves. The result is a graphic novel that is as damning as it is beautiful. An indictment of violence of extraordinary power."

      "Summary (from OCLC): The shocking yet intensely moving first-person account one woman's experience of growing up in Japan's yakuza society. Born into the family of a wealthy yakuza boss, Shoko Tendo lives her early years in luxury. But labeled \"the yakuza kid,\" she is the victim of bullying and discrimination from teachers and classmates at school, and of her father's violent rages at home. The family falls into debt, and Tendo falls in with the wrong crowd. By the age of fifteen she is a gang member, by the age of eighteen a drug addict, and her young adulthood is marked by a series of abusive and violent relationships with men. After the death of her parents and her own attempt at suicide, Tendo turns her life around. A pivotal moment is the decision to get tattooed: an act of empowerment that helps her take control of her life. This is the universally appealing story of a young woman's successful struggle to escape from a life of ostracism and abuse, and a rare glimpse into Japan's closed yakuza world from an insider's viewpoint."

Here he quickly discovers both the long hours of meeting studio deadlines along with the nightlife and artistic haunts of the capital.

Au cours de la décennie suivante, à l'instar de ce qui se produisait depuis quelques années sur la scène américaine, les jeunes dessinateurs français se sont tournés de plus en plus nombreux vers ce genre longtemps interdit de cité dans la bande dessinée: le récit autobiographique. Il est désormais avéré que l'autobiographie dessinée est une tendance de fond de la création contemporaine, même si elle reste pour l'instant essentiellement cantonnée à la petite édition et aux supports alternattivs.\"",
      "English summary (from p. 139): \"Autobiographical Comics. Since the beginning of the nineties there has been a strong increase in the number of autobiographies in French comics. This tendency is in opposition to the themes of traditional output. It is influenced by some great foreign authors, especially Americans in the wake of Justin Green and Robert Crumb. Whilst showing the importance the autobiographic genre has gained in present day comics, Thierry Groensteen questions the place taken by intimist and sexual confessions in this sort of comics, observes the different strategies utilized in the representation of oneself, and attempts to define the particular preoccupations of the various artists concerned.\""

Au cours de la décennie suivante, à l'instar de ce qui se produisait depuis quelques années sur la scène américaine, les jeunes dessinateurs français se sont tournés de plus en plus nombreux vers ce genre longtemps interdit de cité dans la bande dessinée: le récit autobiographique. Il est désormais avéré que l'autobiographie dessinée est une tendance de fond de la création contemporaine, même si elle reste pour l'instant essentiellement cantonnée à la petite édition et aux supports alternattivs.\"",
      "English summary (from p. 139): \"Autobiographical Comics. Since the beginning of the nineties there has been a strong increase in the number of autobiographies in French comics. This tendency is in opposition to the themes of traditional output. It is influenced by some great foreign authors, especially Americans in the wake of Justin Green and Robert Crumb. Whilst showing the importance the autobiographic genre has gained in present day comics, Thierry Groensteen questions the place taken by intimist and sexual confessions in this sort of comics, observes the different strategies utilized in the representation of oneself, and attempts to define the particular preoccupations of the various artists concerned.\""

Former: Olympian, poet, scholar, sculptor, minister, activist, Governor General, entrepreneur, line cook, headmistress, Mountie, columnist, libertarian, cellist.\" After a high-profile family scandal, Sticks escapes to the woods to live in what would be relative isolation were it not for the many animals that surround and inevitably annoy her. Sticks is an arrogant self-obsessed force who wills herself on the flora and fauna. There is a rabbit named Oatmeal who harbors an unrequited love for her, a pair of kissing geese, a cross-dressing moose absurdly named Lisa Hanawalt. When a reporter named, ahem, Michael DeForge shows up to interview Sticks for his biography on her, she quickly slugs him and buries him up to his neck, immobilizing him. Instead, Sticks narrates her way through the forest, recalling formative incidents from her storied past in what becomes a strange sort of autobiography. Deforge's witty dialogue and deadpan narration create a bizarre yet eerily familiar world. Sticks Angelica plays with autobiography, biography, and hagiography to look at how we build our own sense of self and how others carry on the roles we create for them in our own personal dramas.\""

First, in Punishment, Optimus Prime and Windblade team up to stop a killer, but do they really want to, when all the victims are Decepticons? Then, in the title story, the Dinobots accept a dangerous mission into the Cybertronian wilds, but they get more than they bargained for, and are forced to reassess their beliefs in the process. Finally, in Salvation, the Dinobots are reviled for the things they've done. So when their greatest threat, Trypticon, appears, how much will they sacrifice for a world that hates them?"
