Signe Bergstrom examines Wonder Woman's diverse media representations from her wartime comic book origins to today's feature films, and explores the impact she has had on women's rights and empowerment and the fight for peace, justice, and equality across the globe.\""

      "Summary (from amazon.com via OCLC): \"Killing and Dying is a stunning showcase of the possibilities of the graphic novel medium and a wry exploration of loss, creative ambition, identity, and family dynamics. With this work, Adrian Tomine reaffirms his place not only as one of the most significant creators of contemporary comics but as one of the great voices of modern American literature. His gift for capturing emotion and intellect resonates here: the weight of love and its absence, the pride and disappointment of family, the anxiety and hopefulness of being a live in the twenty-first century. \"Amber Sweet\" shows the disastrous impact of mistaken identity in a hyper-connected world; \"A Brief History of the Art Form Known as Hortisculpture\" details the invention and destruction of a vital new art form in short comic strips; \"Translated, from the Japanese\" is a lush, full-color display of storytelling through still images; the title story, \"Killing and Dying\", centers on parenthood, mortality, and stand-up comedy. In six interconnected, darkly funny stories, Tomine forms a quietly moving portrait of contemporary life. Tomine is a master of the small gesture, equally deft at signaling emotion via a subtle change of expression or writ large across landscapes illustrated in full color. Killing and Dying is a fraught, realist masterpiece.\""

      "Summary (from OCLC): In 1962 Jason Fisher was given astonishing powers by the United States government-powers he used to defend the nation as the New American. He and his teammates in the Civil Defense Corps were real-life superheroes. Except that it was all a fraud. A conspiracy. And now, 10 years after the CDC was torn apart by racism, infighting and murder, the Corps' surviving members find themselves pulled in very different directions. Missy Devereaux-a.k.a. Ole Miss-is transitioning from the First Lady of Mississippi into a candidate for governor and defender of a vanishing and hateful way of life. Amber Eaton-formerly known as Amber Waves-has become a domestic terrorist, using her powers to infiltrate and destroy the country's centers of power. Somewhere in the middle stands Jason Fisher, who has remained a crime-fighter even as evidence mounts that he is accomplishing nothing besides propping up a system that's rigged against him as a black man in America. In a nation being torn apart, what does it mean to fight for the American way? Writer John Ridley and artist Georges Jeanty revisit their parallel Earth for a look at its gritty 1970s, a time frighteningly like our own.",

      "Summary (by Katherine Pastor): Noda Megumi (\"Nodame\") is a piano prodigy who has no discipline and prefers to play by ear. By chance, she meets Shinichi Chiaki, the top student in the piano program of a prestigious music college in Japan. Nodame is immediately head over heels in love with Chiaki, but he takes much longer to warm up to her unique personality and quirks. The story follows both of their struggles to pursue their musical ambitions and eventual success. This multivolume manga series had been adapted into two television series (a live action and an animated series), as well as two live action movies and three video games. The Nodame character is based on an actual person of the same name. The main character is not shown with large eyes and curvilinear figures that are more conventional features of female characters in anime and manga."

Ernestillo says that if his father can see his wife and talk to her when he's drunk, he wants to do it too and talk to his mother. When the boys take the bottle from him, Ernestillo attacks with a hammer and manages to knock himself out. His friends put him in his bed, and return to school. The teacher wants to know what they found, and they say Ernestillo wasn't home. The teacher doesn't believe them, and questions them until he gets the truth. The teacher rushes to the carpentry shop, sees Ernestillo unconscious, and calls an ambulance. The boys wait at the hospital while the teacher looks for Mr. Vargas, the missing father of Ernestillo. The news that his son is in the Red Cross hospital shocks Mr. Vargas, and hearing that Ernestillo was trying to see his mother fills him with shame. In the hospital, Ernestillo recovers. The teacher brings Mr. Vargas to his son, and he begs his son's forgiveness."

The Chef has stolen an ambulance and Moreau has sprained an ankle, so Barelli, Inspector Lapiste, and the ambulance driver give chase. The third ambulance they catch is the right one, but it's empty. They find Randor in a doctor's office near the abandoned vehicle, but not the Chef. Randor is soon kidnapped again from the doctor's office. This doctor is a plastic surgeon, and he is working for the Chef. A secret passage from the doctor's bathroom leads to a chase through tunnels.

A Japanese Zero crash-lands near the base, and a woman survives, managing to make the men think they've captured secret plans. After the squadron has left to take advantage of the plans, the woman steals a gun and kills the radio operator. The crew of Madam X figures out what has happened, and leaves sick bay in a suicide mission to spring the ambush the Japanese have set up. On page 7, a Japanese radioman says, \"Silver disks",
      "our greatest arsenal gone! Shoot down that plane at any cost!\" The whiz-bomb shown in p. 1 does seem to be disc-shaped, though from the title and cover art we would expect flying saucer UFOs."

      "Summary: Giddap Joe rides into Axonville, and the town appears deserted. The men of the town are waiting in ambush, however, and Giddap soon has a noose around his neck and is headed for a lynching. Then a little girl, Julie Copping, cries out that Joe is her friend, and the townspeople relent. They had thought that Joe was part of a gang chasing Jim and Rose Copping, Julie's parents. Julie gives Joe the map to her father's gold strike. Joe decides he'd better go help his old friend Jim, so he thanks the townspeople for the loan of the necktie, takes it off, and prepares to leave. Before he can start, Lou Marks knocks him down and steals the map. In flashback, we learn that after Copping found the gold, the crooked sheriff of the town of Garriot has tried to steal his claim. Copping had shot \"sheriff\" Kaye in the arm, and Copping had spent three years in jail for it. Upon his release, Kaye was waiting with to cronies to continue the pursuit of Copping's gold. In the present, Lou Marks volunteers to join Giddap Joe as he rides out to find the Coppings. Marks is sure that Joe didn't see him when he stole the map. In the mountains, Rose Copping's horse is frightened by a rattlesnake, and she falls to the ground and is threatened by the snake. She wants Jim to shoot the snake, but he is sure that the sound of the shot would bring Kaye and his men straight to them. He lassos the snake neatly around its \"neck\" and throws it aside. Rose's horse's leg is broken, and Jim won't shoot it for the same reason, but Rose shoots it out of compassion. Sure enough, the couple is captured in a trice and threats to Rose soon elicit another map from Jim. At the entry to the cave where the gold is, Kaye stops and sends one of his men in to check the truth of Copping's story. The man doesn't come out, so Kaye sends another man in. Giddap Joe and Lou Marks (Lou having had a change of heart) were waiting inside the cave and have overpowered the two men. Joe then steps out of the cave and arrests Kaye."

It turns out the Mustang pilot didn't need help, but when Johnny returns to his flight it's surrounded by German fighters. Johnny's unexpected return saves the day, and back at the base the new pilot reports. His name is Lt. Tom Talon, and like Cloud he is Native American. The other pilots observe the meeting of the two men with these comments: \"Look at the dead-pan way those two are looking at each other!\" \"Just like Indians! Never showing what they feel!\" We learn that as boys the two men played together on the reservation, and that Talon's brother died during one of their games and Cloud is unfairly blamed for the death. Talon has sworn to kill Cloud, though the other men don't know this. On the next mission Johnny Cloud makes Talon his wingman, demoting a disapproving Tex to no. 3. Talon saves Cloud's life after first putting it in jeopardy. The next day Cloud saves Talon's life nearly at the expense of his own, and lands barely alive in enemy territory. Talon lands to pick him up, and they make it to safety even though being fired upon by a German tank. Talon considers the fact that Cloud saved his life to be payment of the debt for his brother's life.",

      "\u0014 <b>Summary:</b> Laureline and Valerian are given the honor of\r\n   transporting Earth's ambassador to Central Point, where it\r\n   is to be Earth's turn to preside over the governing body\r\n   there. Central Point is a millennia-old meeting place with\r\n   segments built by every known spacefaring civilization,\r\n   which is governed by a panel of ambassadors with a rotating\r\n   chairmanship. Just before they arrive, the ambassador gives\r\n   them instructions. The ambassador says that since the\r\n   galaxy is so anarchic, Earth plans to take control and\r\n   straighten things up. Certain other races are prepared to\r\n   back Earth's grab for power. Valerian and Laureline are to\r\n   be his\u0014 <a href=\"/rri/brri/bodf.htm#bdgrds\"> bodyguards </a> and not\r\n   take initiative. Laureline is given a \"grumpy converter\" as\r\n   a source of funds for the undertaking. They have no sooner\r\n   landed than the ambassador is kidnapped by <a href=\"/rri/mrri/mep.htm#ries\"> mercenaries. </a> Valerian\r\n   manages to grab their ship and get taken along, and\r\n   Laureline is left with a protocol officer whose buffet has\r\n   been ruined. Three Shingouz come to visit and to sell\r\n   information. For 1500 pearls, which the grumpy converter\r\n   creates from a sample they provide, Laureline gets a map of\r\n   Central Point and advice to contact some mercenaries called\r\n   Kamuniks. Laureline goes to find them, and Captain Protocol\r\n   goes along, though protesting that leaving one's own\r\n   segment just isn't done. The passageways between the\r\n   segments are maintained by a race called the Zools, who\r\n   don't talk or interfere. Luckily the Zools are oxygen\r\n   breathers, so humans have no trouble moving around. The\r\n   Kamuniks are\u0014 <a href=\"/rri/crri/cent.htm#taurs\"> centaurs </a> who greet\r\n   Laureline by using her as a ball in a game like polo. For\r\n   100 blood-and-guts tabs fabricated by the grumpy converter,\r\n   the Kamuniks advise Laureline to seek the Suffuss segment\r\n   where Bagoulin mercenaries are gathering. The Suffuss run a\r\n   house of ill repute, but Laureline resists their\r\n   blandishments. In exchange for a batch of aphrodisiac\r\n   tablets from the grumpy converter, Laureline is given a\r\n   disguise as a female Bagoulin so she can overhear that\r\n   Valerian and the ambassador are in the hands of the\r\n   Groubos. For a bit of time after making the aphrodisiacs,\r\n   the converter is no longer grumpy. Another thousand pearls\r\n   to the Shingouz and she learns that the Groubos must be\r\n   communicated to through Zuurs Pilots, a kind of symbiotic\r\n   jellyfish. Laureline goes to the Groubos segment, grabs a\r\n   jellyfish and puts it over her head, but the information is\r\n   not specific enough. A homeless man comes along, and for an\r\n   armload of shellfish created by the grumpy converter he\r\n   leads Laureline and Colonel Protocol to the\r\n   Gnarfs-Dreamers. At about this time Valerian and the\r\n   ambassador come out of stasis and are able to communicate\r\n   with each other, and the ambassador says that there are ten\r\n   thousand Earth warships ready to surround Central Point.\r\n   Valerian and the ambassador find themselves on an ancient\r\n   planet of people who consider themselves shadows, but who\r\n   are of the race that originated Central Point. They watch\r\n   things, but don't interfere unless a single power tries to\r\n   impose its rule. The ambassador listens to their arguments\r\n   and has a change of heart. Meanwhile the Zools are massing\r\n   in the passageways with weapons. The converter fills a\r\n   container with coins, and the Gnarfs-Dreamers show\r\n   Laureline and the protocol officer how to get to the planet\r\n   of the shadows. The four Earth people are reunited, and\r\n   Valerian calls himself a hero. The ambassador goes to the\r\n   council to give his speech. The Zools, however, have\r\n   decided to reestablish a moral code, and have convinced the\r\n   council to expel the Earth delegation for 100 years.\r\n   Laureline calls in the warships to help in the evacuation,\r\n   then shuts down one of the engines of their ship so the\r\n   grumpy converter can recharge. <p>\u0014\r\nThis summary is from <i>European Comics in English\r\n   Translation</i> (Jefferson, NC : McFarland &amp; Company,\r\n   2002).
